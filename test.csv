1100,"Came here with the hubby and a friend for a casual dining evening and enjoyed our time here. 

It s something between a casual and formal dinner setting and right in the middle of downtown. They have multiple seating options which is amazing. They had an outdoor patio, indoors on the first floor and a balcony available for seating. On a summer evening, sitting outside was just perfect! 

We ordered some prosecco and enjoyed our drinks when we got some bread and oil. The service was decent but we did feel that they were prioritizing some other customers over us. People who came long after we did got served their bread and drinks while we waited for us. 

Our food was tasty - we got the specials (salmon and pasta) and the chicken in a rose sauce from the menu. Both were delicious. 

The rooftop patio/balcony is where we sat and it was beautiful. I highly recommend sitting outdoors if possible during a warm day. 

When we got our bill, the staff member added the gratuity on it automatically but it wasn t clear. When we asked him to explain what was written on it he started saying something very random which didn t make sense. We had someone else come and explain it to us that it was the gratuity. I did feel that the serving staff could do a bit more to make a better experience in terms of service. But overall this place gets a 3.5 to 4 Star for its food and ambience experience.",2.0
11,"Playa Cabana is a pretty small restaurant, so I made a reservation for 2 for 7pm on a Wednesday night - we were seated immediately, and there were still a few other tables free around us. The place started to get quite busy at around 8, so it s definitely worth making a reservation especially if you re going with as a party larger than 2.

Even though it can feel a bit cramped, the service and food were good. I got the baja fish tacos (comes in a set of 3) - the fish was really good, but I feel like it could have used a bit more guac/sauce around the sides, as it sometimes tasted a bit bland. I wasn t full after the 3 tacos, but generally have a pretty big appetite! 

Overall, I still enjoyed my time, but am not sure if I would return at this price point.",2.0
1494,"Review is for take out. Normally when I order crispy chow mein, other restaurants will separate the sauce and the noodles. Not here, by the time I got home the noodles were all soggy 

The shrimp spring roll was such a disappointment with barely any shrimp, only one bite actually had shrimp in there. 

I ordered via Ritual so I thought the pick up would be simple. There is absolutely no physical distancing at all, the entrance was tight, people were crammed and confused, overall it was chaotic. Improvement needed.",0.0
69,Been meaning to try this place. Finally did. Next door to a childhood favourite of mine (Hunter s; greek food). Welcome addition to the plaza. Good bang for your buck and one of the better Mexican spots in Scarborough. I do think their spicy salsa could do with a bit more spice / kick though.,2.0
1,"Went here with my friends and family. I liked the spice side fillings and their lobster tacos was good I heard. I had the veggie enchiladas and was alright. Even the veggie tostadas was good. However, I feel the food was expensive for the food quality.
We got the 
Nachos - small but good
Guacamole and chips - good needed some spice 
Chicken wings - so so 
Veggie enchiladas - was so so 
Veggie burrito - good 
Veggie tostados - good
Shrimp enchiladas - was so so 
Lobster tacos - very good 
Fish tacos - very good 
Pork tacos - was so so",1.0
42,"Important !!!! The menu on Yelp is NOT up to date. The prices have changed significantly (I ve attached the latest menu). 

Was a tad bit slow to get started (host was talking to a couple eating, when we went to go get a menu ourselves the host told us to wait and he would bring us a menu, but then proceeded to talk to continue talking to the couple for a little bit). Asides from this, service was very good and the host was very generous.

I proceeded to purchase the chicken mole which was very good. The sauce was definitely the best part, it wasn t necessarily sweet or salty, it was just good. This was accompanied by some dark meat chicken which was very tender as well - not so much seasoned but the sauce was enough. The rice and beans were solid as well. Would definitely come here again next time I m in Toronto",2.0
1210,"Food: A very popular place in downtown for thai food and it definitely did not disappoint me at all! I did not order pad thai (what I usually stick with) because I was trying to be more adventurous and I was very glad with my food choices! I highly recommend the pork rice with egg as it was the best out of three. Im guessing the pork was marinated with a lot of different ingredients and so with the fish sauce and lime juices, there was a burst of different flavours going on in a single bite. The chicken wings were amazing as well but nothing too surprising. The curry noodle was very interesting as I did not expect them to use egg noodle, the beef brisket was too hard though. I did still enjoy the coconut heavy flavoured curry overall. 

Portion: Normal to small

Environment: I was put to sit at a high table and the only issue was that there was no where to hang my winter jacket. Other than that the vibe of the restaurant was really nice with all the decors!",2.0
1190,"Had my bday dinner at the counter seating in front of the kitchen, a great spot to watch the chef cooking the dishes. Food was great except the pasta. It s raw, not Al dente. We ordered the octopus. The portion size of each piece has a quite big difference. Wonder if they give s bigger portion for a large table. As we only had two people, we ordered the pork chop instead of the porterhouse. It s lovely cooked with cheeky pink inside. The highlight was the dessert, pine nut tart with wildflower honey and vanilla mascarpone. It s not too sweet with balanced flavour. 
The kitchen gave us a piece of choco tarte as bday cake. It s funny that the candle light was off three times as it s windy above our seats. 
I d love to try their pizza in the future. However I doubt if I will go again coz they don t seem like to chat with asians",1.0
471,"I love the decor of this place! It has a really Mexican feel. There is an inside and an outdoor patio you can sit at. The restaurant also has a outdoor taqueria if your just grabbing a quick bite and a drink. 

We ordered the chips with table side guacamole. It was made fresh and even grounded up right next to us. Next came the elote that was in small square shot glass size. I ordered the shrimp tacos which were spicy and cooked to perfection. My boyfriend ordered a carne asada dish. He devoured his meal so it must have been very good. 

The staff was very nice and quick. Our food was great and portions are reasonable.",2.0

790,"Had a delicious dinner here my first nite in Toronto. Beautiful space in an incredible historic building. We ordered lots of appetizers with my absolute favourite being the Funghi Assoluti (basked oyster mushrooms, parmigiano, bread crumbs, extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, arugula,garlic). SO good! for my main, I chose the Spaghetti al Limone (spinach, capers, parmigiano reggiano shavings, lemon, extra-virgin olive oil). Literally one of the best pasta dishes I ve ever had. Our Braziluan waiter was wonderful & so sweet & attentive. Absolutely love this place!",2.0
573,"Located in a side street of Koreatown, this place is a little hidden gem. Though the entrance before you walk in is large and they have signs indicating it s a restaurant, you would have never thought there would be a restaurant hidden within a side residential street. 

We came on a Friday night around 6:30 and we were the only people there. It slowly started to get busy after. The food is great and not very pricey at all. It is authentic Mexican food. We ordered a corn appetizer and it was really good. The tacos were good and my grapefruit margarita on the rocks just hit the right spot. Definitely worth trying out this place and I ll definitely come back when I m craving for tacos.",2.0
1670,"Fudao is a standard noodle house that gives really generous portions! 

I was actually expecting it to be more of a dipping noodle situation after seeing the photos but it s actually more of a hot pot since you re supposed to toss in all of the toppings and noodles in your broth immediately before it cools. 

For the price, I think it s a solid spot that will definitely fill you up. The service was just OK. I was surprised that there was a decent amount of seating. If you re visiting, it s not a must but if you re looking for a place to get a substantial amount of food for a good price it s worth trying.",1.0
1114,"I had the chance to explore the St Clair area and tried an Italian restaurant. Nodo Hillcrest is a smartly designed space with lots of mirrors, funky lights, and extensive use of pastels.

Okay let s get to the food. I had the Regina Pizza as a sharing. Fior di Latte, tomato sauce, fresh basil on thin crust. Delicious and delightful thin crust it was an excellent appetizer.

As a main I had the Orecchiette Rapini E Salsiccia. Homemade Italian sausage crumbled, garlic, rapini and mascarpone made for a very delicious subtle dish. The pasta was al dente perfect.

The restaurant was like it came out of a magazine. Except one thing. PLEASE replace the centre mirror panel. It s cracked and I couldn t stop looking at it.",2.0
707,"Worth the wait! My friend has been telling me about this place for a while and I have been following Sugo s insta for a while now. So I was super happy to finally have visited this place. It is a small establishment so we had to wait almost 2 hours but once we sat down, it was easy to forget the wait. I loved the energy of the place and the staff were super friendly. You leave your number with the staff and they will call you when the table is ready. The portions here are very generous and the spaghetti sauce is soooooo good. Everything we had from apps to mains were delicious. We also tried the tiramisu and hazelnut gelato which I also recommend. Overall, 5/5 experience and I guarantee you will most likely have leftovers for the next day to relive the deliciousness!!",2.0
1441,"It s one of the few Hong Kong cafes (Cha chaan teng) in Chinatown that i m aware of. It s hidden on the second floor and easy to miss. However, when found, it s a good option for Hong Kong-style Western cuisine in Chinatown.

I really liked their Baked Pork Chop Rice. It was tasty and tangy with generous portions. I would return just for this dish. My mom had the shrimp salad which was generously topped with fruit and shrimp. The Russian Borscht soup was also solid.

Service was friendly and the food came out quickly. Pricing is also pretty affordable. The ambiance is a bit cramped and noisy, but that s to be expected in Chinatown. 

The one thing I found off-putting was the presence of dirty glassware on cashier counter-top. It s almost as if they didn t have any other space for it, as there were 10 or so dirty glasses in plain site.

Other than that, I had a positive experience and will be returning in the future.",2.0

1556,"GB Hand-pulled Noodles truly has the best hand pulled noodles in the area! Even though the place is small and stuffy sometimes, I keep on coming back because of the food. GB s noodles are made fresh to order and they are delightful - love the texture! I ve literally tried all of the noodle dishes on the menu and I absolutely love all of them.

First of all, the beef noodle is great, the broth is so flavourful! It comes in various sizes but I think that the small one is big enough for me. I would say my favourite soup noodle from GB is the Braised Beef Tendon Noodles, but sadly they only have that on Fridays and weekends. They are pretty generous on the amount of beef tendon they give. My most recent visit was during my vegetarian week - so I tried the vegetable noodles with vegetable broth. It was pretty good, and it definitely still hits the spot even without beef! 
They also have dry noodles, my favourite has to be the pork sauce. Their pork sauce is very tasty (a little bit salty though, but it s perfect after you mix everything with the noodles!) and the vegetables they provide in the noodle definitely helped to balance it all out. Their tomato egg is alright too, but it does not stand out as much.
For all of the dishes you can choose your noodle type/width. I usually go for either flat or the widest one! It s also worth mentioning that for the price, the portion size is really good. Most of the time I can t finish the noodles except when I m starving.
They also have a lot of side dishes - the side dish menu has really expanded since my last visit. I love the jellyfish and the seaweed salad!

Service is quick and efficient too, it s not the best but it s one of the better ones for fast-paced restaurants like this in downtown Toronto. 10/10 would recommend :)",2.0
1428,Cool little Asian fusion spot in Toronto. Came here with a group of 4 and we got the lobster and duck to share. It s a bit pricy but the food was amazing and we were all full afterwards. We also got the fried watermelon as an app and it was just as good as it sounds.,2.0
127,"Decided to check this out from Yelp recommendations. When I arrived inside the front door, was greeted right away by the super friendly staff. We proceeded in the back for dining in. The menu had a wide assortment of tacos to choose from, a couple drink options and guacamole. I ordered the quesadillas, the shrimp taco, carnitas and fish taco. Overall the taste of each of the tacos were great, loaded with flavor! The quesadillas was more different then your normal quesadillas, it was quite doughy but was oozing with cheese. I would definitely come back and would recommend to anyone who s looking for some quick tacos and a more quiet atmosphere.",2.0
1268,"Let s talk b nh m . It s the Vietnamese word for ""bread"" and it also refers to a pretty popular sandwich. Baguettes were introduced to Vietnam by the French and in the 1950s the b nh m sandwich was born, one of the original fusion foods. You can find endless versions of b nh m today but the original (and arguably best, in by opinion) usually involves a few different types of deli-style meat, p t , chili, mayonnaise and is topped with cucumber, pickled carrots, pickled daikon and cilantro. It is served cold. I love this straight-up classic version because of the perfect marriage of Vietnamese and French ingredients.
When it comes to b nh m in Toronto, everyone talks about Banh Mi Boys. You Gotta Eat Here! featured them in season two of the show, National Geographic magazine included them in their Places of a Lifetime article about Toronto, NOW Toronto has voted them #1 Best Sandwich 2019, and blogTO has named them as the #1 Best Banh Mi in Toronto. The hype is real. They now have four locations in the city, but you know me, I ve gotta visit the orig. Fashion District. I stopped in to the little shop on a Saturday evening, excited for some bread with stuff inside of it.

Like I said, the shop is small and you won t find very much in terms of decor. Honestly though, in my experience the absolute best b nh m shops are the ones that look like complete trash. So in that sense, Banh Mi Boys is almost too nice. The red pendant lighting is decently atmospheric and there are rustic wood panels on the walls - I certainly wouldn t call the place a ""hole in the wall."" As with most casual joints, you go up to the counter to place your order and grab a spot to sit. While there always seemed to be tables available in the restaurant, the traffic coming in and out of the shop was constant. Many people were taking their sandwiches to go.

One of my favourite things to do in restaurants of varying ethnicities is to try their most interesting drink! It s usually something imported from the respective country and I m always super into trying whatever they ve got. In this case it was a can of Yeo s Chrysanthemum Tea Drink ($1.70). Delish! Kind of like drinking an iced tea, except with a lovely sweet honey flavour.

The menu at Banh Mi Boys includes more than just b nh m . You ll also find tacos and steamed bao, as well as a few different sides. I liked seeing a green papaya salad on the menu as a nice fresh option... But was truly intrigued by the Kimchi Fries (Pulled pork, mayo, kimchi, green onion - $7.50). They had to happen. This was like an Asian poutine, for lack of a better way to describe it! And wow was it ever good! I think the aspect that surprised me the most was that the fries were actually quite delicious and cooked well. The rest of the ingredients are a no-brainer when it comes to a one-way ticket to delicious town. I loved the huge flavours in every bite! The pulled pork was savoury and well-seasoned while the kimchi brought its signature spicy fermented funk. And of course anything with mayo on it is going to be good. I m not sure why my expectations were apprehensive on this one because I was completely blown away. An absolute must-try.

The main show, of course, is the b nh m . There are nine different sandwiches to choose from, all innovative riffs on the classic. Call me a traditionalist, but I did find myself just a little disappointed that there is no straight classic b nh m offered on the menu. Mostly because I know that if there was, they would crush it. However, I can certainly appreciate that they have created nine out-of-the-box sandwiches using some truly incredible ingredients ranging from squid to 5 spice pork belly. There is one sandwich on the menu that everyone seems to talk about though and it was the one that I had to try for myself: Duck Confit (Served on a baguette with pickled carrot, cucumber, cilantro, Luck sauce and onion chutney - $9.00). The first and most important thing about a b nh m sandwich is the baguette. Hands down. It needs to be fresh with a thin, crusty outside and a soft, chewy inside. If the bread is wrong, you might as well forget the whole thing. In this case, the baguette was ideal, providing just the right bite without overpowering the whole sandwich with too much breadiness. Served as a warm sandwich, the generous amount of duck confit was tender and delicious. I loved the way that the Asian flavours from the Luck sauce played with the rich and savoury meat. The vegetables were piled high, adding a beautiful pop of freshness and colour. I couldn t help but love this. It certainly wasn t a traditional b nh m , but what it was was delicious.

One of the main characteristics of b nh m shops tend to be the rock bottom prices. Typically a sandwich will run you about $3, which is pretty much the best thing ever. You likely noticed that this isn t the case at Banh Mi Boys, with their sandwiches going for about three times that price. Keep in mind that they are offerin",2.0
1853,"3.5/5 

Came here for a quick lunch since I heard a lot about the Yonge and finch location of this noodle spot. We were quickly sat down and able to place our order. 

We both got the Biang Biang Mien since it was recommended by the waitress and seemed to be the most popular item from others who came to this place. 

The noodles were interesting given the variety of different toppings that you wouldn t necessarily think go together, but I liked the mixed noodles concept. My biggest issue was that despite there being so many different toppings, the noodles tastes bland and didn t have much flavour to them. It seemed like the toppings weren t cooked enough to bring out the flavours or salted enough to help. 

Overall an interesting noodle concept but I don t think I d return again.",1.0
696,"Dude - the food here is AMAZING. My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich and the rigatoni. We probably should have ordered the Sugo Platter, but didn t realize it was an option until afterwards. The rigatoni was definitely the star of the show - it was piping hot and full of flavor, with the pasta cooked perfectly.

The only reason I m knocking a star off is because I m a selfish American and they were taking American dollar-for-Canadian dollar to pay since we ran out of Canadian cash. It also seems like it would have been overwhelmingly busy if we had come at regular mealtimes, so try to go at a weird time like 3pm for lunch.",2.0

1630,"We came on a Thursday night for dinner. The restaurant is quite small and it is on a basement level, we walked down stairs to get to the front entrance. There were a few tables occupied but many tables still empty so we didn t have to wait.

The restaurant has plain decor and they haven t done much in terms of upgrading furniture and renos, it s quite bare-bones. The menu has a wide selection of various dumplings, buns, and appetizers. To order you write down your menu item number on a piece of paper and give to the waiters. 

We ordered pork steamed dumplings, fried chicken dumplings, fried pork puns, and green onion pancakes. The dumplings were filled nicely with the meat and were quite large. For two people, we ordered more than enough and were very full. I loved the fried pork buns - they were juicy and fried just right at the bottom. I think the food is a little on the expensive side - it averages out to almost $1 per dumpling but for the quality and taste it s worth it. 

Overall a great little family owned shop in Chinatown to get your fill of dumplings. It s generous on the fillings of the dumpling and very flavourful. Yummy indeed!",2.0
1817,"Everything was outstanding. Come with a big group and get a private room and try everything. Loved the Dan dan noodles, snow pea shoots, both mushroom dishes, fried tofu. Prices were very reasonable. They were nice about splitting the checks.",2.0
23,"I visited this place on a weekday evening. They don t have any table reservations and it s the first come basis. You place your order on the counter and then go and find yourself a table. The food is delivered at the table. There is a common area where water & cutlery is available for self service.

The place stands out from the other Mexican places because of their Salsa counter. They have 7 different kinds of Salsas which are free with your meal. Try some of the spicy salsas at your own risk. Their Ghost Salsa is extremely spicy. Now, let s talk about food. I tried their Veggie Burrito, Mushroom Tacos & Grilled Avocado Taco. The portion sizes were good and value for money. They serve complimentary tortilla chips with every entree. Burritos had a quinoa filling but you can upgrade to rice for 1 dollar. Tacos were really good with a nice blend of sauces. For my taste buds, burrito felt a little dry though. Overall, a nice place to try some Mexican options.",2.0
565,"I really like this place. It is bright and clean. The food is good and the service is great. There are two shortfalls; no fish tacos, no liquor license. I always get refritos, guacamole, and tacos al pastor. Al pastor is always missing the Pineapple but is good nonetheless. This place needs to serve beer, una cerveza por favor!",2.0
597,"After hearing great things about Gusto 101 I finally had my turn to try it and I was not disappointed, AT ALL!

I really liked the rustic interior and the restaurant gave a more upscale casual vibe. I felt welcome in just my jeans and sweater. The staff was super friendly and assisted us happily. We had brought a birthday cake to celebrate our friends birthday and they gladly put it in their fridge, and even cut and served it to us after we sang happy birthday. It was returned in perfect condition (except for those slices we ate of course).

On top of the service and decor, the food was absolutely bomb! Our table of 4 shared the Cavalo Caesar Salad (kale caesar), Polipo (grilled octopus), and Mushroom Brushcetta to start. The Cavalo caesar was tasty and every ingredient complimented eachother. I wasn t too heavy and tasted heavenly. The grilled octopus was tender and delicious. The mushroom bruchetta was also delicious and had lots of mushrooms on top.

For our mains we had the Calamarata (Spicy seafood pasta), Taliatelle (Bolognese ragu pasta) and the Mafalde Al Funghi (Mushroom Truffle Cream Sauce). Can I just say, my personal dish, the Mafalde Al Funghi, was THE BEST mushroom cream pasta I ve had thus far, and it s not because I was just hungry. If you love cream pasta, and mushrooms you must try this. Combined with the truffle oil, it just brought my pasta experience to another level. The pasta itself was cooked al dente and complimented this rich sauce so well. I had a sample of the other 2 pastas which were very very good in their own right, but the mushroom pasta was the best in my opinion. If you re lactose intolerant, be wary though.

I m glad I finally got to try Gusto 101 and am looking forward to my next visit hopefully very very soon.",2.0
754,"meeeeeeh.... I really wasn t all that impressed with this place. 

The decor and service were really good for sure. But the food was just OK. Considering how many amazing Italian restaurants there are in Toronto, I would not come back to this one. 

One thing that really surprised me was that the food was cold and didn t taste fresh. It sort of tasted like it had been reheated.

Luck has it that Toronto, the sister city, has its own Miku. Imagine the broad smile that crept on my face as I was researching eating options.

Given we only had a couple of days in the city, we meandered all over. After a day of seeing Nathan Phillips Square and seeing Scotiabank Arena, we walked a few blocks further to Miku for an early dinner. Oh, dude... The food was just as good as I remembered! My fave was the Salmon Oshi Sushi. We also ordered the Miku Roll. It s named after the restaurant so it s gotta be good. We loved everything on our table. Another yummy meal thanks to the Miku staff.",2.0
1728,"Living in Markham & Scarborough before and now close to Chinatown, I had tasted the best and cheap noodle soup. So trying Noodle King for the first time, I wasn t really impressed.

Yes, their Shrimp Wontons are massively huge and I counted 5 pcs in my soup. So I guess that makes a difference considering they give you crappy servings when you eat in food court places.

But I still paid $8.19 for my soup which to me is still not that cheap. Still the soup didn t blow my mind or something.",1.0

They have a menu and a notepad you can write on for what you want (which is kinda interesting). Then give the notepad to the waiter/waitresses and wait for your food!

Sliced noodle stir-fry with lamb ($11.99) - I loved the sliced noodles; unfortunately for me, it wasn t uber uber thick. However I did love the noodle flavor and there was a lot of stuff on the plate for the price that I paid. They have a good amount of meat in there and I was absolutely enthralled of that fact. There were some vegetables in there that I didn t really like, but you know, to each their own haha. I loved having it stir fried and I loved the flavor that came out of it. It s good and aplenty.

Also went for the scallion pancake which I enjoyed; it was cut in 5 pieces. It s a bit of a crisp but not too much scallion flavor really in there, but I do love the flour flavor in there.

Food comes out at a good pace; service is decent - flag em down haha. I do wish I knew what the option for thick noodles are, but not noodle soup hahahahaha.",2.0

1293,"My favourite ice cream shop in Toronto! Huge line ups during the summer, but I think it s worth it! There s no seating but in the summer it s a nice area to walk around in anyways. 

Genmaicha Matcha Tiramisu (Highly Recommended) -- I ve yet to try an ice cream flavour I don t like at Bang Bang. They have so many unique flavours (e.g. totaro, london fog and boba milk tea) and delicious baked goods to pair with them. The Genmaicha Matcha Tiramisu is one of my favourite flavours - creamy, rich vanilla ice cream with huge chunks of soft matcha tiramisu. I think the genmaicha and alcohol is more prevalent than the matcha, but I m not bothered by it because I think the combination works very well. My other go-to flavour is the lychee rosewater with raspberry; pretty much everyone I know is IN LOVE with it. If you haven t been before, you NEED to go this summer! 
 
TIP: Avoid peak times (i.e. after dinner) because the line can get pretty long. ",2.0
1409,"One of the OG restaurants of Toronto s Chinatown. It is a classic ""hole in the wall"" that has stood the test of time. The surrounding area is slowly but surely undergoing gentrification. I remember a lot more Chinese supermarkets and aunties selling vegetables and other items along the streets. 

The restaurant is small and cramped. If you have a seat near the kitchen doors, be prepared for the stench every time the door swings open. You don t come here for the ambiance/service. You come here for Chinese food. 

Washrooms are in the basement, as with most restaurants in the area. 

Service is as expected from a Chinese restaurant. Effective. 

Ordered:
""Fish sliced noodle soup"": I chose vermicelli, which is thin rice noodles. The ""fish sliced"" is actually a blend of mystery fish made into a cube pre-cooked and sliced. It s probably the same item used for hotpot. Instead of this topping, I d recommend the fish balls (you really taste the ""fishiness""). 

The soup is clear and very mild in flavour. It s not overly salty. A plus is the vegetables that accompany the soup. 

Observing the other tables chow meins, rice dishes etc., I believe Markham Chinese food / Congee Queens provide much better value (quantity:price ratio)",1.0

Service is impeccable and comfortable - there s a genuineness to lengths the servers will go to ensure you re happy. In terms of quality of food - all I can say is excellent.

I ordered Beef Tripe Noodle Soup and my sister ordered the Wonton Noodle Soup. The noodle soup are filling in my opinion and definitely worth its value (under $5 without tax!). I tried both noodle soup and I preferred mine over my sister s. The tripe was so soft and chewy. As well, I liked the meat broth taste - a bit less bland. I also ordered the stir fried clams in black bean sauce and they were very delicious. I never thought of the combo of black bean sauce and clams, but they complemented well and a definite must-try if you like clams. I recommend this restaurant- definitely worth the money for their food. 

However, disclaimer is that they ONLY ACCEPT CASH.",2.0

The only thing is that my food was supposed to go in the oven, so my husband dish came first. He finished his meal and then I finally got mine. We complained nicely to the server, but I don t think it made difference.

1878,"First of all, let s be clear. Growing up in Asia, I have tasted the best of the best! So I m not easily impressed by Chinese restaurants overseas. Lai Wah Heen came with rave reviews by Canadians, so I thought I d check it out and see how it measured up to restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Verdict - Lai Wah Heen, which is supposedly 5-star here in Toronto, has dim sum that any 3-star restaurants in Singapore (eg. Mid-tier Wah Lok would win hands down) and Hong Kong can easily beat.

The presentation was nice. The taste profile of some of their offerings were decent, but there was only ONE stand-out dish that wowed - and that was the lava custard buns, which were flawlessly executed.

My biggest complaint was the skin on the steamed dumplings. The skin was too thick (especially the lobster dumpling) and chewing through it was laborious.

Overall, it s not worth the price.",0.0
983,"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the Yonge/Eglinton area. It was recommended to me by a coworker and I am so glad I tried it out. The first time I came here, I ended up coming back multiple times within the month. I was obsessed with the food. Specifically, ordering the tasca and the basta. Usually when I go with my boyfriend, we order one of each and share. They are so delicious but if you have to choose one only, definitely go for the tasca and you won t regret it. I ve tried the pizza as well and I would definitely recommend getting pasta instead. The pizza is good but their pasta is just so much better.",2.0
1191,"I love the ambiance and service of this place! We came for a company dinner, and got seated at the window seat. The decor of this place is quite simple and minimalistic, and the lighting is minimal and very warm. There are these warm yellow tubes and lights hanging from the ceiling, with lighting coming from the chef s open kitchen / bar.

I got a mocktail drink, the albicocca. It was a nice light drink, slightly sweet from the apricot but also balanced with the sourness from the lemon. I pointed out a chip on my wine glass, and the waitress apologized profusely and immediately switched it out. She was super kind and attentive throughout dinner.

We shared a bunch of food, all of which were excellent:

Burrata Appetizer:
This appetizer was the special of the day. There was a ball of creamy burrata topped with prosciutto, both on top of a sourdough bread spread with sweet tapenade. The mash of textured was very interesting. The mild flavour of the burrata matched perfectly with the sweetness of the spread, balanced by the salty prosciutto. It s pretty good, but a fairly small piece. We split it among the four of us, and we each got a little over a bite.

Tomato Panzanella:
This appetizer came in a small bowl; the orange and red tomatoes were well-marinated in a basil olive oil mixture. The toasted bread was fairly interesting - the once crispy bread was a little soaked and soggy from the mixture. This was interesting, but not necessarily one of my favourites.

Radicchio di Castelfranco:
The slightly bitter radicchio was coated with a slightly sweet honey dressing, creating a lovely mixture and balance. I particularly enjoyed the sweetness of the soft bosc pears, juxtaposed against the crispness of the hazelnuts. I particularly enjoyed the hazelnuts and honey dressing!

Insalata Verde:
The bibb lettuce was cut rather largely and came in whole leaves. It was nice and soft, tossed evenly in the lemon vinaigrette. Since one member of our party is vegan, we got the parmesan on the side. To be honest, I found this salad quite overpriced.

Roasted Carrots:
Miniature, adorable orange carrots sliced in half arrived in another small plate (I m seeing a trend with the sizes). The carrots were approximately the length of my thumb, and were quite sweet! Slightly oily, but still a classic side nonetheless.

Crispy Potatoes:
These potatoes were amazing and SO flavourful! I loved how the outside was super crispy and crunchy, with twigs of rosemary coating it all. So addicting... I had a ton!

Polpo e Fagioli:
This dish comes with a whole small octopus! The octopus is tender; it was probably boiled before, but definitely grilled after! There was a nice char to the ends, which made it quite crispy. It was plated on a creamy mixture of cannellini beans, and the salsa verde was a lovely addition. To be honest, I probably had all of this dish to myself... One colleague had perhaps a leg. No problem - I thoroughly enjoyed and savoured every minute of it!

Chestnut Agnolotti:
We got this, but omitted the guanciale. It was absolutely delicious! Perfectly creamy, and the ultimate comfort food. The agnolotti was bite sized, stuffed with a nice amount of chestnut mash. I thoroughly enjoyed the sprinkled cheese and occasional wilted green! We all raved about this dish, and this was definitely one highlight of the meal.

We also ordered two pizzas - I tried the L Amatriciana. The crusts were super thin and there was a great char. I enjoyed the saltiness of the guanciale, though I did find it a little too fatty at times.

We then shared three desserts among us four - all were utterly delicious!

Cesta di Frutta:
A lemon and basil curd came within a baked meringue base, topped with candied berries (strawberries and blackberries). The meringue was fantastic! It was the perfect chewiness and crisp. I also enjoyed the tanginess of the curd, though the lemon flavour lingers and comes out mainly at the end. 

Lemon Crostata:
This was very similar to a lemon meringue pie - the lemon curd was heavenly! A classic comfort, and topped with a dollop creamy meringue.

Torta della Nonna:
Honestly, I didn t expect I d enjoy this much, but I loved it! The honeyed pine nuts were glorious and so nutty and addicting. The tart base was also well executed, and the mascarpone cream balanced it all - the smoothness against the crispness of the tart, the mild flavour framing the sweetness and nuttiness. Would definitely get this again!",2.0
496,"Always service with a smile at this incredibly clean and tidy little restaurant! The customer service is second to none with this authentic Mexican food!

1851,"One of my favourite places to get noodles!!

I came here for the first time a couple of months ago and i remembered i ordered the biang biang mian and it was absolutely delish! The first time i came, the place was pretty crowded because it was a Friday night but everything, from food quality to service, was still decent.

I came back a couple of days ago. I m trying to reduce meat consumption as much as possible and I was soooo glad to see the amount of vegetarian/vegan options they have!! I tried the vegan kudai mian and it was delightful - loved the flavour and the texture of the noodles! Also tried some side dishes: okra cauliflower, tofu sheet, and bon bon chicken. The okra cauliflower was AMAZING. The okra was cooked nicely and the whole dish had a really nice citrus-y taste, 10/10 would recommend! The tofu sheet and the bon bon chicken were served with some peanut sauce which was superrrr tasty. I also tried some of my sister s dan dan mian and i d say that i prefer the texture of the wide noodles.

Would say the only downside to this place is how small it is and how it s super crowded during weekend dinners.",2.0
268,"One of my fave Mexican places in Toronto. Food and drinks are great and it s a fun vibe. 

Definitely order the Mexican corn to start off with, its delicious and big enough to share. My favourite tacos are the fried chicken with peanut sauce (I believe the pollo frito), the baja shrimp tacos and the carne asada. Three tacos usually fill me up.

1421,"2.5 stars. Nice casual ambiance. The tasting menu is around $190 for two, after tax and tip. I was let down by the food. They have a tendency of using very strong flavours that were overwhelming and competing with each other.

For instance, the pea dumpling had black truffle, bone marrow, and bacon. I wish I could have tasted the pea filling and bone marrow more because that was quite delicious, but it was overpowered by the more dominant flavours.

The wontons in sweet chili sauce was my least favourite dish. It was way too sweet (desensitized my tasting buds for the next dish), and the wonton wrappers mushy and falling apart.

The tacos were doused in aioli and it made the whole thing just taste like spicy mayo.

The fresh leaf wrap was very good and texturally interesting.

I didn t think the tofu ""cheese"" Caprese salad was anything special, but the tomatos were nicely peeled to soak in the dashi.

The smoked duck is a smart menu item because it can be prepared ahead of time and has a longer shelf life, can be served cold (well it was served cold to us so I assume that s intentional). The downside is that the fat is not rendered at all. and cold duck fat can be very rubbery. The skin was also unpleasant. It was not similar to a duck prosciutto where the fat is tasty and thinly sliced. The purple potato mash was very boring.

The ""famous fried rice"" tasted purely of black truffle oil, so if you like truffle you ll enjoy this. Thankfully there were no other competing flavous. I didn t think it was special. I think dousing things in truffle oil is a bit of a copout.

Our server was very nice, but he was quite busy. We had to wait a long time for water sometimes, and the sparking water cups are so tiny that I was constantly running out. No pitcher or bottle for the table. Time between dishes is also long.

Overall I don t regret coming here, but I m not sure if I d come back. The value for the quality of food was not worth it for me. It certainly was interesting to try once.",0.0
1072,"I live in the Yonge/ Egg area and always heard this was supposed to be the best place on Yonge for food as the neighbourhood is quite lacking in the food area to begin with. 

I had high hopes for this restaurant but was gravely disappointed with the service and the food. The flavours they have are all wrong. Most of the food was very pungent and did not have a smooth flow of flavours. It was rather sour the risotto we ordered. We also ordered prawns and the sauces they chose were sour and pungent with too much salt. ( it s all in the sauce for Italian dishes). 

The Gnocchi was okay, it tasted like the Costco brand in a cream sauce ( who could mess up a cream sauce tbh) anyhow I am very disappointed. I did not find the food appetizing at all. The flavours were all mixed up and not great on the palette. 

My waiter unfortunately was very short tempered and seemed agitated the whole time whilst serving my family and I. Whenever we did need something he was never available and would rush off before we finished speaking with him. 

Anyway sad to have to review it like this but that is truly my opinion.

My friend ordered the spicy sausage pasta which was tasty as well. She said it was al dente and the pieces of meat were good. It wasn t too salty or saucy. 
The complimentary bread was mediocre. It was cold and came in a folded paper basket. A small bowl of olive oil was hidden underneath. The olive oil was delishhh though!

I checked in on Yelp and luckily check in offer is a free cap/latte/tea - yeah! I also ordered a slice of the veggie pizza b/c I was a little hungry. They do have a pretty good food menu - from breakfast items, to pizzas to pastas. 

Seating is in the front - a few tables and off to the side in a little room - which is so nice - fireplace, clean tables, nice art. 

The veggie pizza (the menu says they use whatever seasonal veggies they have on hand) was pretty good - medium crust, nice and crispy crust and you could see the veggies - mushrooms, peppers. Not like some veggie pizzas where everything is diced up so fine you can t see anything. It came with a little side salad.

I ordered the latte and it was nice - smooth and flavourful and they do latte art here! I got the teddy bear :)

1863,"Relatively new noodle spot that opened up downtown just at Bay and Dundas. Came by with a few coworkers for lunch and the consensus was that it was okay. 

Even though Artisan plus was packed when we arrived. We were lucky and was able to get seated fairly quickly for a party of 6. 

We were seated on the high top right in front of the kitchen and got to witness the staff in action. It still amazes me how efficient the kitchen works, it s a well oiled machine. 

I ordered the appetizer trio, pork bun, and clam mashi. The appetizer trio was a combo of enoki, bean curd, and tripe. Of the 3 the tripe stood out the most. The bean curd and enoki mushroom were okay at best. The trio comes with dipping sauce that tasted very similar to a peanut sauce. 

The pork bun was shared among the group and we found that although the pork was really flavourful and moist, the bun itself was a tad on the dry side. Not the good kind either. It s worth a try but I wouldn t be ordering this again if I visited again. 

The clam mashi was amazing! I ve gotta say I could have done with without the other two items on the menu but the clam mashi is a must. Be warned, it s a little spicy. I would say out of 10, would be about a 7 on my scale. Not to the point where the heat was unbearable and unenjoyable. It definitely lingers and I found myself going through water pretty quickly. The clams were declines in the dish and there was quite a few in there to enjoy. This was my first time having mashi and I m now a big fan of that.",1.0

My friend got the steak (which was actually cooked medium rare, with the fruit salad in mayo sauce appetizer, and a hot lemon tea. The appetizer were good, and came quickly. The entrees were huge, and tasted delicious with the classic Chinese black pepper gravy. The tea is not what you come here for, but it wasn t bad, just not noteworthy in terms of Chinese tea. Both of our meals also came with a soup option that was the classic Chinese borscht - that is more tomato soup than borscht.

I must ve seen five Uber eats pick up their orders way after me and there were two or three people behind the line that got seated for dine in, and got served their food before me getting my order. 

After waiting patiently for an hour for my take out order to be completed I went up to the cashier and told them to cancel our order since it wasn t even made at that point. All they said was that they were really backed up. I spoke to both workers and said this isn t right that you guys didn t tell us we have to wait A whole hour for take out.

We had the queso, which was really delicious, but sadly only came with three tortillas - the Jen Agg rule is to not be a dick and give a number divisible by the group at the table (so we should have gotten 4). I have to agree. 

The pork huaraches was the star and I highly recommend it. The ""weak sauce"" served on the side was right up my alley. I didn t love the fish taco, and the chicken taco was pretty good. However, the tortillas were really well made and delicious, and the variance of flavours between all items means I d definitely be back to try some other things and get more huaraches.",2.0

I have been eating here for the last 10 years, over the years I started to know the waiter s waitress and the chefs and they all have 1 thing in common and that s great customer service but unfortunately over the years I did notice a drastic change in the dinning in experience. 

The restaurant has got really busy where at times you ll have to wait just to dine-in and even if you do decide to wait to dine-in the restaurant is SMALL and it being over crowded, barely any room to move you ll feel over welmed!

Depending who s on shift some waitresses will try to rush you to order and leave (since they are that busy) the experience of dinning in has declined. I do not recommend dinning in.

I have stopped dinning in for the last 5 years, i have been using Ubereats or just walking down the street to pick up my order. 

The Calamarata Con Gameria is what has me being a loyal customer, the chefs have made my gameri perfect everytime over the years. I personally have never had the desire to try something else off there menu. I have been busy enjoying my Calamarata Con Gameri :) I highly recommend trying.

We waited in a line and ordered the five spice pork belly banh mi, kimchi fries with pulled pork, mayo, kimchi, and green onion, and a tofu taco with cucumber, slaw, carrots, cilantro, and mayo. I thought the prices were maybe a little high for being considered ""$"" as listed in Yelp, but the prices were definitely still good. I would describe the food here as very American Asian fusion (and that s not necessarily a bad thing!). 

My husband enjoyed the banh mi, and we both were TOTALLY wowed by the kimchi fries. These are a must-order!!! They do not skimp at all on all the toppings, so it s really excellent value. I don t eat meat, but it was very easy to pick around the pulled pork, for the most part. The tofu taco was a little underwhelming, which is why I rated this place four stars instead of five. I m assuming the tofu taco is not what they re known for. ;) It was definitely good, but there was very little flavor to it. The tofu was very plain. I think it would have been better if it had had kimchi!

There are much better restaurants in Toronto that deserve to take its place on the list, and especially much better ITALIAN in Toronto.

I had the calamari to start which was fresh and came with some shishito peppers which was fun. But I find nowadays calamari is pretty good at most places. For the mains I had the ravioli (cello spinach, stracciatella, walnut pesto) which is not a dish that would bring me back to the restaurant again. I found the walnut pesto to be overpowering and very gritty/thick, but to be fair I actually don t like walnut that much. 

The pizza I had was thin crust and just nothing amazing. There is MUCH better pizza elsewhere all over Toronto.

633,"One of my new favorite restaurants! Their menu changes constantly, but there are classics that stick around. I visited on Valentine s Day and was pleasantly surprised by how spacious it was inside as the exterior looked unpromising. The entrance can be difficult to find, as you need to walk down an alley facing King St.

The atmosphere inside was perfect for a date night - gently lit and very romantic. All of their meats are cured in house, and you can see it as you walk through the restaurant. Service was unbeatable - our server was very helpful in providing recommendations (as it was our first visit), and checked on us after each course. Water glasses never went empty, and the table was wiped down frequently.

As for food...

Tonno ($19): albacore tuna, my favourite dish from the evening. I m a big fan of tuna and this dish was not only visually appealing, it was a delight on the palate. I could probably eat 5 plates of this myself, as it s so light and refreshing. Don t be intimidated by the chilis - it s definitely not a spicy dish.

Nodini ($8): tiny bread knots with garlic and olive oil, they were so crispy I thought they were fried (but they re not!) a must try if you visit, one of their most popular menu items.

Cervello ($10): lamb brains wrapped in prosciutto, it was a little salty for my liking, and lamb brains are definitely an acquired taste (really it s the texture more than the taste), but a really interesting experience if you re feeling adventurous.

Salumi di buca ($32 for 5): we opted for the soppressata and petto d oca, which came with pickled eggplant preserves on the side. Delectable, and easy to see why it s such a popular item on the menu. You can customize your board, choosing between 2-5 meat options (they also offer a cheese board).

Bigoli ($26): duck egg pasta with duck offal ragu, the serving size is small, but the taste was unbelievable. You can tell from one bite that the pasta was made in-house. Since we tried so many things on the menu the small serving size didn t bother me, but if this is all you plan on ordering, you may leave a little hungry.

Pizze bianca ($30): I can t remember the name of the pizza as it was a special menu item, but it was topped with grilled pears and salumi and was an absolute treat. The pizzas here are a decent size, with an ultra thin crispy crust.

Tiramisu ($15): classic Italian dessert, enjoyable, but it was about 80% cream and only 20% ladyfingers. I d recommend you share this with someone else as it s quite heavy.

Panna cotta ($15): topped with black cherries, cookie crumble, and balsamic reduction, again a very heavy dessert and I wasn t a fan. The toppings were incredible but the panna cotta itself was very tough (almost like a hard jello), and virtually flavourless.

The prices are steep for the small portion sizes, but it s a treat if you do decide to visit.",2.0
472,"I come here several times a year and its still the best! One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. 

2 years ago they had a dish called the Love Boat which was one of my fav dishes but they discontinued it. I stopped coming as often because of that but decided to revisit for the guac! OH MY GOD. Best.Guac.Ever. They will crush and make the guac in front of you which is a cool personal touch. The flavour is just right! You can taste the hint of lime, the onions and tomatoes! To top it off, the chips they provide are to die for... 

I would also highly recommend the original margarita! One of my favs!! My friend and I once ordered a pitcher and both got pretty drunk off it haha! Perfect amount of tequila in each glass and overall just the perfect amount of sweetness. 

In terms of atmosphere, the inside is pretty dim with loud music. I ve sat inside once and can say it is definitely an experience. I did the tasting menu that time, and i believe it was $65/person and you get to experience a bit of everything! Definitely worth it if you have the appetite, I was too full for the best part... the dessert... WHICH TO MENTION, WAS MY FAV PART! I have to talk about the churro.... LITERALLY THE BEST.

From the outside, it doesn t look too big, but the restaurant is very spacious with three main dining areas. Service was excellent; the staff here know the menu well and leave nothing to chance. 

Now to the food ...
* Caesar Salad - it s made at your table. I never knew salad making could be an art, but JCS has proven otherwise. The final product was delicious and a must if dining here.
* Mussels - we enjoyed two types.
* Bread - it came before the meal. Think the bread used for bread pudding, but with cheese baked on it. The garlic butter was a nice touch.
* Steak - you can t go wrong. Let your server know your preferences and you ll be directed to a cut that you enjoy. I had the tenderloin from Argentina.
* Lobster Risotto - I broke my no rice rule for this. If I return, I can skip this dish.
* Sides - We ordered mushrooms, rapini and fried potatoes. The fried potatoes were good, but nothing to write home about.

Overall, I had a wonderful dining experience. Hopefully there s something else to celebrate soon so I can return! 

Good for: steak",2.0

We needed the table by 8:30pm but the table before us was just wrapping up. To make up for this, he gave us a bottle of rose and glasses to welcome her the moment she came in. He also waived the cake cutting fee, which would ve been $2 per slice for 16 people. I would highly recommend Taverna Mercatto if you need to book a large party without a minimum spend!",2.0
1858,"Another month has come and gone and here we are in the heart of Toronto just doing our thing. We ve walked by Artisan Plus many time and we finally gave it a try. This place was buzzing with people around the lunch hour however the wait for a table for two wasn t very long. We waited may be 5 mins.

As this was our first visit we wanted to try a few of the appetizers and different noodles dishes. As such for the apps, we ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo which is handcraft artisan bread with chopped braised pork belly and gravy. The braised pork belly was quite tasty however it did get quite messy because of the gravy. We also tried the Shuan Tofu Sheet which was made of fresh tofu sheet mixed with bean sprouts, shredded red pepper, scallion, gourmet chilli, peanut and sesame sauce. This dish had the very slightest numbing spice. However this dish was slightly on the oily side and the tofu sheet were too long.

For our mains, I tried the Famous Yo Po Biang Mian which was ribbon noodle, sauteed tomato, scramble egg, cauliflower, potato, carrot, organic cloud ear mushroom, edamame, grilled zucchini, paparika, and vinegrette. The ribbon noodle was super long which made eating the noodle slightly difficult. However the flavours were different and interesting. Nothing that really made my taste buds dance. There was no numbing spice to this dish. However if you don t eat spicy on a regular basis I wouldn t recommend this dish. My husband tried the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. Surprisingly the Lamb wasn t super gamey. Again the noodles were all super long and the flavour was okay. However, I still want to try their noodle soup one day. 

The service was on the ball. The waitress was always around in case you needed them. Than again the restaurant wasn t super large. There were probably around 40 seats.",1.0

I had 3 tacos: carnitas, barbacoa and black tiger shrimp. They were my favourite in that order. The tacos have minimal toppings, but that actually made them taste better. The tiger shrimp had a coleslaw type thing on it and cilantro. Keeping each taco to only 2 or 3 toppings helped emphasize the juiciness of the meat. The carnitas was my favourite because it was juicy and a little sweet.",2.0

The service was welcoming, friendly, and attentive. Our server checked up on us often and refilled our water frequently. 

FOOD:
Beef tartare - Loved this! I highly recommend

Calamari - this was very average. I would recommend skipping this and order another appetizer. 

Seafood pasta - this is one of their popular dishes. The sauce was on the lighter side but it was still tasty. Noodles were cooked perfectly. 

Carbonara - this was a daily special and it was well executed. We absolutely loved this!

1509,"This is my first and last time trying this place, here is why:
1. Service: I get it, lots of people come here for food, lineup is long, and not that many waiters, but when I was trying to order food, the server was literally so impatient that he kept tapping his fingers on the table loudly, I spent like 2 minutes thinking and he made me feel like I was wasting his time. This is a big NONO for me.
2. The rice noodle roll around fried dough : for all the people on yelp who recommended it, I really think u should try more places for this before recommendation. I have never seen people put it in soy sauce, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CRISPY and u put it in liquid, what is the common sense here? And the bottom layer of it was so soggy I didn t even know what I was eatin, mush or food. Then I took a bite of the top layer rolls which did not touch any of the sauce, the fried dough was so soggy and soft and then I suddenly understood why they had to put sauce on it ---- to cover the fact that they don t even know how to make this dish. DO NOT ORDER.
3. Two meat combo rice - roasted pork and roasted duck. When we asked them about the roasted pork, waiter said ""it s crispy"", it WAS 100% NOT CRISPY. I don t understand how do they expect people to pay for dishes with this low quality, I really don t get it.

I can find at least 3 restaurants which costs much less in Chinatown and still beats this place in every aspects, so if I were u, I would avoid it for life.",0.0

And warning that the complimentary salsa is very spicy! Also, not that it s the restaurant s fault, but there s a huge sidewalk planter right in front of the entrance which made it pretty much impossible for our stroller to go through. A wheelchair would definitely not be able to pass so heads up. Otherwise seems like a casual and family-friendly place.",1.0

The quality did not differ from their regular service which is always a good sign of consistency. 

I gave it 4 stars because while it was good, it wasn t the best I ve had at this price point. However, I would and do continue to come back as it is so central in the city. I definitely would recommend for first timers who don t want to break the bank for good sushi.",2.0

The restaurant was walking distance from the UofT building I was working at. This was a really great getaway from the snow storm that was happening outside. We walked in without a reservation and were seated immediately. 

The bruschetta appetizer was very tasty and fresh. They had these cute little olive oil and vinegar dispensers on the table with the oil on the outside part and an olive shaped insert in the middle with the balsamic vinegar. Definitely a nice touch. 

The penne arrabiata and seafood special were delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was tangy and spicy. We were offered fresh black pepper and parmesan as well. I ordered a glass of valpolicella ripasso, which took me back to when I was in Italy last year. 

The tiramisu was also unique - it had a different liquor in it, I think it was sambuca. It gave it a very unique flavor and we loved it. Definitely will be back.",2.0

After waiting about 30-40 minutes, we luckily got a little table right inside to dine in. We could see the chefs freshly making the pasta and cooking our meals at the same time while almost drooling to get it. 
We order the black truffle with tagitelle pasta, the bolonese with tagitelle, and red sauce with spinach and ricotta ravioli. All were just divine, and so worth the wait. Everything from the freshly made pasta, to the flavorful tomato sauce, and the freshly grated truffle was to die for. Ravioli filling and the red sauce was my favorite dish. 
Definitely 10 outta 10.",2.0
762,"Hovering between 3 and 4 stars. The food was delicious to be sure, but the price point was extremely high for the portions we received. I realized the pasta is made in house so that accounts for a lot of it, but it still just felt pretty pricey given we didn t really order that much and got pretty hungry again a few hours later.

My husband ordered the ravioli (8 small ravioli in dish. It was FANTASTIC but a tiny portion) and I had the mushroom tagliatelle (also great but just mushrooms tossed in a light sauce with a bit of parsley). We also split the chocolate cake for dessert and I had a glass of wine and the whole tab came out to around $70. WHAT. The night before we ate at another restaurant with dishes packed with seafood, veggies, meat, and more and we spent the same amount of money for around 8-9 small plates of food. And everything was made from scratch there as well. 

The experience was nice, and the food was good but I would probably not return given you can get more for your money in Toronto at other locations and have an equally delicious meal.",1.0
1109,"From beginning to end a wonderful dining experience. The service was expert and unobtrusive, very attentive with several servers assigned to each table. The ceasar salad was very credible, better by far than most, followed next by one of the best Spaghetti Pescatore s I ve had. The dish had mussels, manila clams, shrimp, calamari and scallops; there was no shortage of good quality fresh seafood. A very light tomato based sauce reduced with a seafood stock dressed the perfectly cooked aldenti pasta. A good quality Red Velvet cake is very hard to fine has been my experience not at Donatello there s is one for the ages. The restaurant has it all together, you will find that menu items are made fresh to order so expect wait times to be longer but well worth the delay.",2.0
1625,"I was craving soup dumplings and this restaurant has such good reviews that I just had to come here. It s a tiny restaurant down some steps, so it might be hard at first to find if you don t know what you re looking for exactly. There isn t a ton of seats, so if it s busy, you might need to wait for a table.

The restaurant itself could use a huge facelift. The washrooms were dirty and very small. The whole place just feels outdated - minus the tables and chairs. I came on a busy Saturday night but was seated fairly quickly. They cleaned my table before I was seated but the dish cloth they used to wipe the table was definitely used.. my table just smelled like a used dish cloth, sadly.
There were also a TON of mosquitos. We were seated right in front the of door, so perhaps this could be why.. but the most odd thing is that they would just drop onto our table and food, and almost die or stop moving instantly. Not sure what was going on.. but it ruined my appetite. 

ONTO THE FOOD: the most important reason why I m reviewing! We ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings (soup dumplings), fried shrimp & pork dumplings, & chive pancakes. The soup dumplings were just okay. The filling wasn t as flavourful as other ones that I ve tried from other places. It was missing something but I can t figure out what it is. The pancakes were really good, and I wish I ate more but they were dripping I grease, so I couldn t eat more than 2. I didn t have any of the fried dumplings but my boyfriend said they were very greasy as well. We actually had to go get a drink from a bar close by just to get rid of the greasy feel in our mouths.

I honestly wouldn t come back here myself. A lot of other people gave this place high reviews so I m not sure if I just had a bad experience or not. But the greasy food and mosquitos flying around or dropped dead in front of us wasn t acceptable.",0.0

I liked the simplicity of the food because the taste was just great. Simple doesn t have to mean bland. For a Tuesday evening I didn t expect it to be so busy. But it was very busy. If we didn t have a reservation we would ve been waiting a long time I think.

The first item on the set menu is the appetizer of chips & guacamole. It was made fresh & even ground up fresh in a stone bowl. Next came the charred corn off the cobb in a small square shot glass size. Yummy! After that we have the diablito salad with Israeli couscous, then pollo loco (chicken taco), baja (fish taco), squid & chorizo kebab, and then churros for dessert. I had a mushroom taco since I m allergic to fish. They are able to customize for those with allergies. I m lactose intolerant & allergic to fish. So I had different items than what was on the set menu.

Waitstaff were quick & nice. Everyone has to wear red on top it seems. I think only the managers didn t wear red. The old wood reminds of reclaimed wood from ships. But apparently it was reclaimed from the old distillery buildings. I d come here to eat again & I actually want to bring hubby here to try the food.",2.0

We ordered the 3 for $12 ( Black Tiger Shrimp, Fish & Carnitas tacos). The food was flavourful, however it didn t hit the spot for me. We also took advantage of the free chips and salsa check in offer.

Also, everything was fairly priced!! 

We got the mozzarella sticks, meatballs, pepper poppers, calamari & half pasta and half salad - and none of the food disappointed!! The mozzarella sticks had the cheesy pull, meatballs were soft and the sauce went perfect with it. As for the calamari, it was soft and perfectly salted!!

I don t know why I was expecting more of a kitschy Mexican restaurant, but that s not what we got. Instead, it was very intimate and cozy and the service was stellar... We had a great night!

To start, we opted for some guac which was tasty and had a nice little kick to it. To eat, I split the elotes a la parrilla and an order of tacos al pastor with my husband. The soft tacos come in an order of three but you can add on a fourth, so we did that to share evenly. It was the perfect amount of food for us, especially since the tortilla chips kept flowing! The pork in the tacos was seasoned very well. I m used to the meat being cubed rather than in strips, so this was different but still tasty. They really packed in the filling, so I left super full. 

To sip, we shared pitches of mojitos which were nice and strong... The drink menu was quite lengthy and again, perfect for our group of revelers.

Is this a teeny tiny place? Yes. Is it extremely hot and muggy in here? Yes. Will you wait for a ridiculous amount of time in a lineup outside? Yes. BUT IT S WORTH IT. Look, I ll wait all day for a good taco. I don t even care.

I tried the carnitas taco and the beef taco. Both were phenomenal and I m just gonna make a bold statement - these were some of the best tacos I ve ever had. The beef taco in particular was a stand out. The meat was so tender that it practically melted in my mouth, and the flavors were an absolute explosion of deliciousness. I love how they pile fresh cilantro on these babies. There s also a supplemental sauce station (in addition to what s already on the taco when it s handed to you), but I just went for a squeeze of fresh lime and that was all I needed.

Wow finally a review from me that s not on poke bowls or Asian food! Byblos was everything that I expected based on the awesome reviews from friends and here on Yelp. First of all, the service and atmosphere were top-notch. I was here with a group of 4 girls and we were seated at a cozy round booth upstairs. Our server was honestly so helpful and offered up some great suggestions. For example, we initially wanted to share a couple apps, some mains and carbs, etc. but we were unsure about how much to order. She suggested that 8 dishes would be a good start since they usually recommend 2 dishes per person because the portion sizes are small. And by small portion sizes, they were SMALL. This was good in the sense that we were able to share a lot more items, but also meant that the bill was quite hefty so it definitely is more of a nicer meal. Here is a list of what we ordered and my rankings (I don t remember the exact names sorry): 

Favs - Roasted beets, Spinach pide (so creamy and delicious), Short rib kebab (so tender!) 
Average - Turkish dumplings, Black truffle rice
Meh - Spanish Octopus (5 tiny pieces lol), Fried chicken (very dry and not much flavour)

504,"I was very excited about trying Quetzal. Upon arrival the ambiance was great, with candlelit tables and a curved ceiling, like being inside of a ship. The bar seating was inviting and the drinks menu was inventive and cocktails were superior with great notes for sipping.

For the food we did the tasting menu, since there were many unique dishes that we wanted to try. The sea bream and scallop ceviche was underwhelming, with the scallops being were quite small and not fresh tasting. The other sushi grade fish - the kanpchi tiradito - was good in comparison. The thin crispy Masa round was similar to a taco pizza, and a fun app to share. 

Next up, the kale salad was tasty and served with the full stems. The bone marrow came with two large bones but didn t seem to have enough flavour cooked into it. Lastly, the skirt steak and 18oz rib eye were served. We were never asked how we liked it cooked when ordering, but we received medium rare which worked out to our tastes. 

Overall, great value for a lot of food and high quality ingredient based dishes, but nothing stood out at the end of the night. I was hoping for a little more bite. 

It s a beautiful restaurant otherwise, and maybe I m just not the right fit for palette.",1.0

389,"I m a huge fan of Authentic tacos, and in many ways consider Tacos El Asadore the measure of quality tacos for Toronto. Don t anyone suggest Wilber s, except those hipster never been to Mexico wannabes. 

Anyway. This soot is true to Yelp tips, small setup inside a butcher shop. Likely more Mexican stream joint than butcher shop, given the sq footage, I ll bet they expand and take the whole place over soon. 

I went pretty safe, grabbed a couple steak tacos at $6 a piece. The corn tortilla was authentic and really good, while the meat was mildly seasoned and unfortunately a bit too full of gristle for my liking. Yes, glad I had a napkin. 

One thing I liked are the accessible condiments as wanted. Onions, cilantro, hot sauce and mild. All fresh, all good. Once you add everything and bite, you ll feel like you re warped to a small taqueria in Mexico. Well done.

The biangbiang noodle has too much vegetable in it(XD which isn t bad, but I would be much happier if there r more pork), instead of the pork belly which they were claiming on the menu, I think it s more like pulled pork texture, so if u don t like pulled pork texture, go for the beef option. The jiamo is like a bun with lots of meat inside, it s it s very filling I can t even finish it. 

Second time here, the line up is equally long, we had 5 people and they are too tiny to fit us, we had to squeeze and it wasn t comfortable. I ordered the clam mashi noodle which is like a Chinese style gnocchi , ITS SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have never had mashi like this and I m really impressed!!!

133,"I love me some tacos where I don t need to wait/fight for a seat (for now because there is no way Good Hombres will stay a hidden gem for long).

Just off of Bathurst and Dundas, Good Hombres is off the main corner in a less populated part so traffic is slow. If you re unsure where it is, it s past the Vietnamese restaurant from Dundas, scross the Shoppers in West Toronto.

From start to finish, this small restaurant was perfection. We were greeted as entered, and felt so welcomed throughout the night. When I say restaurant, it s not one that serves you per se - you order at the cash, pay, and take a seat along the bar in front of the chefs. They ll serve you your tacos piping hot, always fresh and made to order. If i recall, there are only about 8 seats (maybe 10).

Thier menu is small, offering tacos ($3.75 each) and recently added, quesadillas. Between my boyfriend and I, we had 12 tacos but could ve eaten more because they were so good.

Our top two contenders were Pollo Asada and Pescado. The Pollo Asada was light for a chicken taco, and the chicken was very juicy. The Pescado is fish, who doesn t like fish? The fish was thick, meaty and the toppings really complemented. Of the 6 I ate, 3 were Pescados.

The others we tried were Chiles Toreados - very pepper-y, Costillita de Res - delicious beef rib, and Tinga De Pollo - I don t really like pulled chicken so not for me. Overall, the flavours were all so different and so was the presentation, I was looking forward to each taco.

Highly recommend. Go now before it gets more popular!",2.0
526,"I ordered the pulled pork Campechano Torta which was on special through Ritual eats. It s sort of like a taco one a sandwich was interesting to try. The bread is toasted till it s crunchy which helps prevent it from getting soggy from the salsa s and sauces. The meat was tender and came in a good quantity. One of the salsas was a bit overpowering compared to everything else, but otherwise the sandwich meshed well.

There s no obvious sign indicating where the restaurant is, until you actually get to in front of the door.

1161,"Dimmi was ok but it wasn t anything special. My husband, daughter and I were in Toronto for a quick family vacation. After sight seeing we went to Yorkville to shop. Of course all of the shopping made us hungry. We walked up and down the street to find something to eat. We finally decided on Dimmi. I had a taste for pasta and thought this would be a good choice. It was pretty busy but there was no wait. The staff was very nice and accommodating.

When we first got there my husband and I ordered drinks. He got a Old-Fashioned and I got a Sangria. He enjoyed his drink. My drink started off good but then started to taste like medicine the more I drank it. Needless to say I didn t finish it.

We started our dinner with ordering the Kale as an appetizer. Of course this was a side salad. It consisted of shaved kale with pinenuts and cranberries covered with pecorino cheese in a lemon and olive oil dressing. This salad was very good. The flavors were nice and most of all I enjoyed the pinenuts. They added a nice crunch to the dish. 

For our entrees I ordered the STRO ZZAPRETI ALLA ERNESTO and my husband ordered the Roasted Chicken Breast. My dish consisted of spicy nduja sausage, rapini and cherry tomatoes in garlic and olive oil. This was something different for me but good. The sausage added a nice hint of heat but not too spicy. The pasta was good. It also had cherry tomatoes and spinach. I could have done without the spinach. I like spinach in salads or creamed spinach but I don t like plain cooked down spinach. The texture is odd in my opinion. Other than that this dish was good. My husband s dish came with vegetables and roasted potatoes. The chicken was pretty tender but flavorless. The whole plate was flavorless for that matter. It was very bland and needed seasoning. My husband ate it but he wasn t thrilled. 

Last, we ended our meal with a dessert. We ordered the Apple Crumble. It came out in a slice but instead of pie crust topping it had a crumble topping. It came with a scoop of ice cream. This dish was decent. It was pretty tasty. It s one of those things that is wasn t bad but it wasn t the best we have had.

We visited for dinner on Saturday evening. When the server appeared to fill our water glasses using a plastic pitcher we knew it was a bad sign. Most disappointing dining experience. We made the reservation based on reviews. I m simply shocked this restaurant has a 4.5 rating. The food attempts to be high end fine cuisine but is really just pretending. We had the caprese salad. The tomatoes were large (rock) hard basic garden tomatoes - served freezing cold. The mozzarella was rubbery, not creamy like a caprese salad should be. The arugula was a basic run-of-the-mill salad. Excessive and boring. I had the black cod special. The portion was huge and that was all it had going for it. The cod was served on a big bowl full of under cooked garden vegetables (carrots and cauliflower) with watery-tomato sauce. It was a dish you d expect at a family restaurant chain. It wasn t served how black cod should be. My husband s excessive serving of orecchette was bland and served in a bowl of liquid. 

The only positive feedback we can share...the martinis were delicious and the server was lovely and friendly. 

It was a cold evening but the dining room was uncomfortably cold and the washrooms were FREEZING. Yes, it was a very cold evening in the city but this is a restaurant - it should at least be warm. I understand the restaurant has been around for over 30 years - they ve had plenty of time to figure out the heating. 

The dining room is old and tired, not in a charming way. There was paint peeling from the ceiling above us. We were seated at a table beside a shelf loaded with about 100 bottles of wine that hadn t been dusted in the restaurant s 30years. I ve not seen a worse display of wine.

I loved that it was a family-owned restaurant - that s whey we went. It s low end and overpriced. This is not a Yorkville-grade restaurant. Save your money.",0.0

The service from Qing nan was flawless, her kind, sweet, and helpful disposition made it an absolute pleasure to dine here during lunch hour. She was working the floor, taking care of all the tables, preparing the deliveries, and taking payment for take-out orders, and still her service was great, jus

They have been open for 7 months now, and they definitely have the right combo, of staff, food, and atmosphere to be around for a long time to come.

The decor was simple, relaxing, and comfortable. The washroom was immaculate and again simply decorated closed off by a frosted swinging glass door to access the area.

I had spaghetti 2000 (real name of the dish, very futuristic) and with their special tomato sauce with a touch of cream (also recommended). I was upset with myself for having eaten at all earlier that day. I assure you, I will be having spaghetti 2000 for breakfast.

You order in front, get seated and they will bring you your order. The service was quick and friendly. 

We ordered the elotes and every taco on the menu. 
Favourites:
- elotes - creamy, sweet and savoury but kind of pricey for one corn 
- the unoriginal 
- carne asade
- baja fish 
- All the meats have great flavour, and not dry. Fish was nicely fried to a light crunch.

I love the salsa bar! So many options! I especially love the pineapple salsa, gave a nice sweet punch to some tacos. 

The seating area is not that large but it is fast-paced whereas people leave after they finish.

648,"We finally got to Buca (King W, Toronto) for my Birthday. 

I m so happy that we did, you can tell they take prides in what they serve there. Every little detail is known by the staff so you feel like you re getting the experience of passion, and a unique dish. 

After requesting our servers top picks (as I always do) she insisted that we allow the kitchen to choose for us (umm.. maybe on another budget lady $55 for a personal pizza, maybe if you re buying) and then suggested we pair something from every section of the menu, followed by an entree each. (Really, who eats like this?) I felt slightly annoyed by her lack of flexibility with recommendations. 

My BF and I shared the PARMIGIANA DI MELANZANE ($16) it was mouth watering and I LOVED it, he thought it was good but didn t blow his mind I would recommend trying it but it s not a huge portion so, perfect for two.

I originally went thinking I would try the gnocchi as it came highly recommended but, our server mentioned that the menu had just changed so it would most likely be a different one and suggested I go for something different. I agreed so I went with what she described as a house favourite. 

I ended up with the BIGOLI ($24) torchio extruded pasta, duck offal ragu, Venetian spices, mascarpone, basil. It was rich (comparable to a thicker cream based sauce), I liked it but wouldn t order again. Personally, it felt liked pasta and blended cream sauce. I need something added for texture/ variety. I didn t personally wow me, especially in contrast to his entree which was the CRESC TAJAT ($28) we both preferre. The pasta with octopus, mussels and tomato base was phenomenal!! I had plate envy the entire time, watching him grab different bites lol. 

Anyway I can t complain not a morsel of food was left from any of our 3 dishes, and we were seriously stuffed to the brim. 

Next, I need to try their branzino, gnocchi & pizza! 

Definitely, can be on the pricey side if you add a bottle of wine, two entrees and an app to share (our bill came to $160 ish) forgot to mention, instead of your typical dessert that restaurants usually give you for your Birthday they gave us a pasta dish take home and two small cookies",2.0

OK I went with the grilled calamari for $18 and a side of rapini for $10 instead. Well, the calamari was alright, I like the tomato arugula salad a lot underneath but the rapini wasn t good as it was super hard to chew.

The server was extremely rude - I asked for an iced tea (canned drink) upon being seated after a 20 minute wait and the server legit said ""just order your drink when you order everything else"" and walked away, even though it was simply a canned drink that takes 1 minute to take out of the fridge. 

When it came time to order our meal, I asked for the drink again, which the server acknowledged. I didn t receive the drink during my whole meal and no one came to check on us so I wasn t able to reorder. 

When the bill came, they actually had the audacity to charge us for the drink that I never received, and when we asked them to take it off the bill they didn t come back with the bill for over 15 minutes, and didn t print a receipt for us because their ""machine was broken"". 

Honestly I m not sure if we were charged for it, but a place that would allow their servers to talk to/treat customers like this is definitely not a place that I would recommend to others because it says a lot about the restaurant s values and culture, and the food is definitely not special enough to put up with this kind of service.",0.0
1200,"Went on a Sunday night and there was already a line. We got a table for two within five minutes. For a Thai restaurant, I would have to say this place has an unusual ambience -- it s dimly lit with popular North American songs blasting on speakers throughout the restaurant, and can be quite loud. There is also a full bar here if that s your thing.

All in all, the food was great. The Gaeng Kiaw Wan In a Coconut is a green curry dish served with rice and extra green curry in a bowl on the side (the waiter said it was because it can t all fit in the coconut). It is a dish more on the spicy side, but I would say it s still manageable. The coconut really gives this dish some character, and you can also scoop out some coconut meat with your spoon to eat as well. You can choose between chicken, beef, dish, or tofu & veggies.

Khao Soi is also a curry dish but it is a coconut curry dish. It is more sweet than spicy but still has a kick of spice to it. I like the combination of egg noodles and crunchy noodles. We got braised beef chunks (like the ones you put in beef stew), but you can choose between chicken or beef. I thought this dish might be overhyped when I was reading Yelp reviews prior to coming here, but it really is worth the hype.

995,"Eating at Eataly is a mission and a half. 
Starting with the half mission, parking. Looking for public parking or street parking was a disaster. Found out after, I could have parked at the Manulife centre and received a 2 hour parking voucher if $50 was spent at Eataly, located upstairs, which was validated by reception, located on the main level. Yes, that s the process. Wild. 

That was the half mission - on to the full mission. In addition to navigating to find Eataly from the streets, you ll have to navigate to the Manulife Centre then up to the second floor. Here, you ll have to navigate through hoards of people, waiting in line or casually roaming around. Once you ve done a full walk and decided where to eat, it s another 1-2 hour wait for a table at your desired restaurant. Tip. Do it the reverse way. Go to the restaurant and make your reservation THEN roam around. 

Finally, on to the food review. 
I chose La Piazza. Three items. 

Mozzarella ball. This was 4/5. It was soft and fresh as expected. Sprinkled with olive oil and salt. 

Mushroom pizza. 2/5. Basic pizza. I know. While consuming, I had a feeling I ve had better at a mom and pop local pizza shop.

Penne. 3/5. Average. Nothing special to say. It was al dente - which was advertise. 

Verdict. Would I return? No. So much hype for no reason. Crowded beyond belief. 

However, if you made it this far, please try the cannoli - it made the trip worth it. They offered classic cow milk. They do offer the traditional sheep milk, it s definitely an acquired taste. These were 5/5.

It did seem to lack the Sichuan peppercorns and the mouth numbing effect. I m a fan of salty but it was way salty. I think it was the preserved black beans that put it over the top.

This afternoon I had trouble choosing which restaurant to have brunch at. We decided when it was 2 pm. Luckily, their brunch time is until 4 pm. So, we came to try out their eggs! 

FOOD (3.75/5)

- LA GRANDE COLAZIONE ($16). The dish comes with two hen s eggs, Italian sweet peppers salad (pepronata) and flatbread (tigella) . We saw the picture of the dish with FENNEL SAUSAGES on Yelp. It interested us and we both wanted to try it. However, I couldn t order the same dish as my husband did. I wanted to try something else also. I had a bite though (sigh). The sausage was small. It wasn t enough for two people lol. 

- UOVA CROCCANTI ($14). The dish came with three crispy duck eggs and topped with Buffalo Ricotta (cheese) and Pesto Genovese. The eggs and cheese were very flavourful. If you like cheese, you will love this. I m not a big fan of buffalo ricotta. I like the taste but the smell was too strong for me. 

DRINK (4/5) 
We had Latte Macchiato ($3.95) and Americano ($2.90). Both were good. We love coffee. 

SERVICE (3/5)
I don t really want o say that the service is mediocre. There are many reviews say that their services are great. Maybe it wasn t my day. My server was alright. She answered what I asked for but not really what I wanted. It was my first time and I wanted her to explain to us more about the menu and recommend us what the signature dishes are or what the most popular ones. We also don t know Italian! She said something. Short, and that was it! I could catch that those first few items on Salato section were salad and the half on the bottom were egg dishes, I guess. lol, I was disappointed! I was so excited at the beginning becuase I finally had a chance to come to try the brunch menu at Bar Buca. She just turned everything upside down. - -""

1672,"If you dine at Fudao, you should expect a very generous portion of food (due to their unlimited noodle refill) for an extremely reasonable price. However, what stops me from giving this place a higher rating is that I didn t find myself wanting more throughout the meal. 

I tried the Fudao rice noodle and thai curry and Teppan grill squid skewer. I expected the squid to have a nice grilled/smoky taste but when it came to the table, it appeared to have just been boiled(?) and dipped in sauce. The rice noodle dish presentation is pleasant at first, but then you have to dump all the sides immediately into the boiling pot in order to have everything cooked properly. Once this is done, it becomes just like any other noodle dish. The meat was actually surprisingly soft/tender but only 3 pieces will come with the meal.

Regardless, Fudao does seem to be a popular restaurant in Toronto and was packed when I came, so perhaps it s worth a visit. Personally though, if I was back in town, I wouldn t go out of my way for it unless I just wanted to get full for a cheap price.",1.0

In the absence of information I went the safest route of ordering a plain congee and a steamed bun. My order would easily have been more than double if the right information was provided. 

So on the limited items that I could have, my review is not a review per se. One cannot mess up a Congee and a bun.

However the food did not arrive all together and out of respect for others, all of us had to wait. Which resulted in food going cold. 

The congee and bun were as good as they can be",1.0

- Size S is perfect for a good portion. Size L is massive if you re hungry.

TLDR; Broth was delicious. Beef was flavorful and tender. Noods too chewy. Very quick service.",2.0

715,"A very popular Italian restaurant, but didn t quite live up to the hype.

We came on a hot summer day and it was very crowded. We ended up getting a seat upstairs outside on the balcony, but it was very crowded--both in terms of people and seating space.
The seats were pretty minuscule and packed together. There was barely enough space for us to squeeze between the tables to sit down on the outer seats--despite being on the thinner side myself. My other friends, who chose to sit on the inner side, would definitely not be able to squeeze into the outer seats because they are tall men who also hit the gym--their extra pound of muscles already cut them from sitting here, so I can only imagine the types of people who are regular patrons. 

We got the calamaratato con gamberi, mafalde al funghi, rigatoni bologanese, and risotto nervosa.
The server recommended the calamaratato con gamberi since it was a popular dish with some spiciness, but it was quite lackluster. The dish wasn t spicy at all, granted we re quite accustomed to spicy foods. 
The mafalde al funghi was delicious and creamy with a full bodied flavour. 
The rigatoni bologanese was a very typical pasta that tasted like a deconstructed lasagna--which isn t a bad thing. It felt too commonplace and lackluster for this price point though.
The risotto nervosa was probably the star of the show. The risotto is amazing and creamy and the braised beef pairs well with it. Though I will admit that the beef, when eaten on its own, felt a little dry. 

Perhaps it s because I m more accustomed to Asian food, but this restaurant felt quite underwhelming and overpriced.
Many of the dishes didn t stand out too much and is quite comparable to what you would find at much lower price points or even store bought. Don t get me wrong, the food was good, but perhaps not worthy of a second visit.",1.0

I m giving a one star penalty because they don t offer duck in any of the combos. They only offer half duck minimum orders. I was super bummed. I ended up ordering BBQ pork and soy sauce chicken with an absurd amount of green onions sauce. It sure hit the spot. I was super jealous of my brother s roast pork order.

85,"Knowing where to get the best tacos in town is serious business. As it stands, the best tacos that I have ever eaten have been at Tacofino in Tofino and Tres Carnales Taquer a in Edmonton. After reading that Seven Lives was voted #1 Best Taco 2018 by NOW Toronto, named in National Geographic magazine s Places of a Lifetime article, and called #1 Best Fish Taco and #1 Best Tacos by blogTO... They seemed like a sure bet.

You ll find Seven Lives located in Kensington Market, one of the most eclectic corners of the city which suits them well. I visited the tiny shop on a Friday evening, prior to their early closing time of 7pm. They re definitely more of a lunch or early dinner type of place. It should also be noted that they accept cash only, so come prepared!

The tiny shop is bustling and exciting, buzzing with taco energy. The bright walls and giant sign that reads ""TACOS"" sets the vibe perfectly. I also appreciate their logo of a cat with a fish in its mouth - and the insinuation that this cat is down to seven lives, having already lost two. There is one table that can seat about four people and then there s a little bit of standing-room-only counter space. This makes things a little bit awkward if you plan to eat-in, as I did. The table wasn t available and so I stood at the counter in front of the window to eat instead. Which was fine. But certainly not ideal.

The menu is fairly straight forward, including nine types of tacos, some sides, and some beverages. Your order is placed at the counter with a friendly staff member and they call out your name once the food is ready.

Starting with something to drink, I was happy to see Agua de Jamaica on the menu. I always prefer an agua fresca when visiting a Mexican establishment, although I was also happy to see that Jarritos Mexican sodas are also on offer. (Their cola is my personal favourite of all of the colas.) Agua de Jamaica, otherwise known as ""hibiscus water"" is a beverage that exists in several cultures. In Southeast Asia it is known as Rosella tea and it s basically the same thing. Tart and sweet, this refreshing drink was a perfect accompaniment to the food.

We decided to get a Side as a bit of an appetizer. Tortilla Chips (Made fresh! - $3.00) and Guacamole ($3.00 for small) seemed like the way to go. I was a bit surprised that the guacamole didn t just come with tortilla chips and that both items had to be purchased separately. However, I did enjoy the homemade nature of the chips and that a heaping amount of them are tossed into a brown paper bag and given to you. I ll take a bag of chips any day. Golden and ultra crispy, these tortilla chips are exactly what I wanted them to be. They were seasoned really nicely as well. The guacamole was fresh and bright, with a great acidic kick to it. Obviously chips and guac are a match made in heaven.

Next it was time for the big show: the TACOS. Of the nine tacos available, two of them (the Adobada and the Carnitas) were already sold out. On the plus side, I probably wouldn t have ordered either of these anyway. Although, I must say that this did not leave much for meat options. There were four fish/seafood tacos, one beef and one chicken option, and a vegetarian. Nothing for pork at all. But again, I did not mind at all because I was going full ocean food - it s what they specialize in, after all.

Baja Fish ($6.00) and Gobernador ($6.00) were the ones for me. I loved the little condiments bar to the left of the counter that featured three different salsas (hot habanero, medium tomatillo, mild guajillo) as well as chili oil with sesame, and a bowl of sliced limes. This makes it very easy to customize your tacos to your preferred specifications and to control the amount of heat that you desire.

The tacos did not take very long and before I knew it, a green plastic basket was placed in my hands. The tacos were certainly vibrant and demanding to be eaten.

I began with the Gobernador (smoked marlin, shrimp & cheese). If Seven Lives has a signature taco, this is the one. Their front window even says ""home of the Gobernador"" right on it. I definitely loved the smokiness from the marlin the most, while the shrimp filled out the taco and added more texture. Everything had been grilled up deliciously. The pickled onion brought a great hit of balancing flavour and I liked the fresh tortillas a lot.

Next I had the Baja Fish (fried haddock). The first thing that I noticed is how generous the portion of fish is! The haddock was big, juicy and fried to perfection. The rest of the taco was kept very fresh with cabbage and fresh homemade salsa on top.

Both tacos were packed full and were pretty messy to eat, but in the best possible way. I liked both tacos but found them to be missing something that I can t quite put my finger on. I guess that I was hoping for something even bigger and more unexpected in terms of flavour. They were good... Just not the best that I ve ever had.

Broth is perfectly seasoned (I asked for them to make it spicy and to add green onions and coriander/cilantro). Broth may seem bland to a lot of non-Asians but it was just right because of eating it with aforementioned side dishes.

107,"Delicious Mexican food - though to be frankly honest, this was my first try eating authentically Mexican food not associated with any chain. The server was very friendly and cute, and upon entering the restaurant, the first thing we noticed was that everyone there spoke Spanish! We stook out like a sore thumb.

My sister had crazy cravings for burritos, and so she ordered their burrito ($10). While she didn t have any choices for fillings, she was able to choose the protein choice and ultimately selected the beef fajita (flank steak). A massive brick sized, densely stuffed burrito soon arrived. It was filled with seasoned rice (omg the rice was so good by itself - I believe it had been cooked in some broth and so was unbelievably flavourful and umami), refried beans, fatty and crispy seared flank steak, cabbage, corns, tomatoes, etc. It was then topped with sour cream. The burrito was really filling but so delicious! My sister was stuffed by the end of it but couldn t help herself spooning lots in her mouth.

I was really craving soup, and was torn between the consome (lamb with chickpea soup) and pozole (a red pork soup with hominy). In the end, the server recommended pozole, and so I ordered that (even though it was a solid $5 more expensive). The soup came filled to the brim with pork, and some chicken, as well as hominy. It was my first time eating hominy, and found its dense mushy texture to be very interesting. Before I seasoned the soup with any of the provided garnishes, I found the soup to strongly resemble a Chinese pork and bean soup that we make often. 

The pozole came with limes, radishes, onions, spicy red peppers, some thyme bits, tortilla chips, and a green salsa verde. After adding the lime, onions, and salsa, the soup s flavours were all accentuated and enriched. It was absolutely delicious! I only wish that there were less hominies and more broth...

Overall, a very satisfying and deliciously authentic Mexican meal! Highly recommend.",2.0

We went in for lunch in this small and welcoming restaurant, with us in a line against the wall as we wait our turn for our feast. We were quickly given the bar seating along the perimeter.

Our waiter was snappy, funny, casual, and informative. Real cool guy that gave us everything we need to make a solid decision on what to order. That decision was... to order as much as possible.

We ordered the spaghetti, gnocci, rigatoni, and deli sandwich along with chicken parm and meatballs. My main dish with the chicken parm was excellent, with the chicken juicy and well cooked. I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE GNOCCI. That sharp, zesty sauce really complimented all those soft dough meatballs, mozzarella cheese, and chicken. Also, I love how each pasta has it s own dedicated sauce. The spicy pink sauce with the rigatoni was my second favorite; I ll probably go that way with a veal parm next!

Thanks Sugo for the great experience, my friends and I will be back soon! #werenotfromnyc",2.0

Veal marsala with penne

Ok:
Shrimp and scallops in wine sauce

Meh:
Roasted bell peppers. They re ok, but the quantity makes no sense unless you have a group to share with.

This type of food is really not my thing. A bit too straight forward and bland.

The food is simple Italian, but not special. The veal was well seasoned but a bit chewy. Still it was better than the shrimp and scallops dish, which contained small scallops and shrimp which seemed overcooked or reheated.

Olive oil and vinegar bottles are covered with corks which are very greasy. I have no idea how these could possibly be clean. Your fingers get dirty at minimum.

For the price, I expect higher quality or at least more interesting food.

The seafood pasta is absolutely delicious, the bread they bring to the table is to die for, and the servers are friendly and very experienced.

I m not typically a fan of red wine, I normally prefer white wine, but when you have a glass of red wine with seafood, it just adds so much flavor to your food. I give this place 4 stars. I would ve given it 5, but the restaurant is very small. Imagine having a cow in your living room surrounded with packed together families taking their teenage or twenty something kids out to dinner. That s how small the restaurant is.

1257,"We had a quick bite at Banh Mi Boys as it was conveniently located near our hotel. The menu is a decent size, and you purchase the Banh Mi sandwiches separate from the sides. The prices are okay for the portion, however it would be nice if the sandwiches came with a little more of the vegetable slaw toppings, as the bun to topping ratio was a little much. Our sandwiches came out quickly and were warm. 

We tried one each; I went with the Spicy Pork Belly Banh Mi, and my significant other chose the Squid. My sandwich was really good; the flavors were fresh and delicious. I went with the medium spicy, which was a spicy sauce. It was just enough spice for me. I would have liked to see more of the slaw/toppings on the sandwich. My significant other s Squid Banh Mi was also very good, and he went with the spicy option of adding jalapenos. He also wished for a little more of the toppings. 

Banh Mi Boys was good for a quick counter service option to dine in or take out. My only issue was probably the cleanliness of the place; there was food on the floors and crumbs on the tables, and the garbage was overflowing.

The staff was helpful and polite though a bit stiff. Nonetheless our order was accurate and the tea was always filled. We had dinner on a Tuesday night so it wasn t overly busy but there were some larger parties dining.

On to the food: so as I said, I m Chinese and have grown up around eating this food in and outside of the house.

I ve tried a number of their menu options and noodle selections, but my favourite has to be the pork wonton noodle soup with egg noodles. The pork wontons are huge and juicy, packed with lots of flavour. The wonton wrapper is a bit thicker than normal wrappers, but I think this helps keep the flavour packed in. You get 5 of these in the dish and it also comes with 2 stalks of bok choy and 1 stalk of broccoli along with your choice of noodles and broth. Not a fan of the rice noodles (thin or thick) as they do not retain any of the flavour from the broth and are quite bland to eat on its own. But the egg noodles are great as they do hold in the rich and flavourful and not too salty broth. The portion of this dish is huge as well as it leaves me struggling to finish the whole bowl!

You ll be hard pressed to find another place like this in Toronto. This is the best. The dishes here are an experience. You ll leave here, walk a block, and then want to return for more.

509,"While we are Mexican cuisine aficionados, our experience with the food hasn t strayed far from the quotidian comforts of Chipotle and Taco Bell. The concept of haute Mexican cuisine was entirely foreign to us. 

We were seated at the bar, which which is at the front of this incredibly beautiful restaurant. The restaurant features low ceilings and incredibly soft lighting that gave it a very romantic feel. This place is seriously Instagram-friendly.

Mixto ceviche: 3/5 This was the biggest disappointment of the night. I love a good ceviche, and I was so excited to try this after seeing pics on other bloggers feeds about the Mixto. When it arrived, the dishes didn t match: there was less than half the amount of scallops as the blog post I referenced from a year ago. The dish itself was pretty good - it was halibut + scallops in a sour, acidic bath.

Citrus salad 4/5 We really enjoyed this salad, and the simplicity in ingredients really surprised us. It featured grapefruit, navel oranges, and a green salsa. Atop the oranges were sous vide chayote slices to give it a light crunch. 

Blue corn masa cakes 5/5 This dish was the highlight of our night. The consistency of the cakes was absolutely amazing - it was crispy yet soft at the same time. It s hard to believe that this was a vegetarian dish; the mushrooms were extremely juicy and worked perfectly with the cheese. We could ve eaten 5 of these each.

Sweet potato 3/5 This dish was highly recommended on yelp, but it wasn t fantastic. The yam was good, but tasted boiled - the smoke didn t really get through. The sauce was good - it resembled Lao Gan Ma closely - a Chinese black bean peanut paste. Overall, things didn t really mix together. If you do get this though, make sure to order a batch of tortillas to make sweet potato tacos!

To sum up our critique of this place, we think it s fallen to the classic trap that fancy establishments fall prey to when trying to modernize a classic cuisine: losing the integrity of the flavours. Everything felt too refined, not punchy enough. While we understand the value of restraint and nuance, we can t help but think that the fieriness that defines Mexican cuisine was overly diluted. Quetzal ranked 23 out of Canada s best 100 restaurants. While it was a tasty meal, we wouldn t put it in our top 50. 

Also there s only 1 washroom. This means long lines. Don t hold it in.",2.0

176,"I ve been looking all over town for the most authentic taquer a in Toronto, and think I ve finally found it. Campechano had a great patio, hearty tacos, great corn tortillas, and a solid margarita.

Pastor - definitely one of my new favourite tacos in Toronto. The meat was well marinated, had a strong spicy kick (a little spicier than I expected tbh but not too much) and the sweet acidic pineapple complimented it perfectly.

Campechano - the meat in this one was incredibly juicy and well cooked, and the sauces were nice and light, unlike many places where it can be an overbearing addition to a dish. 

Overall I would definitely come back here, order both the tacos again, and I can t wait to try more of them.",2.0
444,"Two types of tacos:
Gourmet = two tacos with cheese in middle with loads of stuff inside. About $8 each. I d say they are better and more complex than the latter, but at $8 is a bit steep.

Street: More simple one tortilla tacos. Still really good and about $4 each.

I d say in general the tacos are really good. 

The service is quick, though when we were there, there was only one other person so the chef made ours immediately.

The complimentary chips were made on the spot, I saw her frying them while we were there in preparation. Though if you ask for more, it is another $1.50.

The sauces, and get yourself were delicious. I really liked they Mexican mud and the green one, forgot the name.",2.0
659,"What else can I say but amazing Italian food. I have been there 3 times and never have been disappointed. I have tried various items from the menu and all have been great. Some of my favourites:
Appies: Grilled Eggplant with Ricotta cheese, Grilled King mushroom
Pasta: Anything with lobster!, Spaghetti with meatballs or Ragu

This place is an unassuming friendly little joint that doesn t pretend to be pretentious. The prices are reasonable - A large lobster with pasta for $40?! and the chef is super friendly. As other Yelpers have indicated, this is not a place that will impress you with its decor and ambiance but the food is the star of the show, as it always should be. 

From what I can gather, small talk with the chef and pictures adorned on the walls, the chef (Korean descent?) has been classically trained in Italian cooking from other master Italian chefs. And yes, he has definitely learned well from them! 

Give this place a try. You will not be disappointed. Trust your instincts and trust the yelp rating!",2.0

I love Mexican food but enchiladas have never been my favourite - but I took him up on it anyways. The chicken enchiladas were good but not amazing - I should have stuck with my go-tos of fish tacos or a burrito (both looked great). 

Good portions. My gf asked for a rum and coke but the only hard liquor they have is tequila which is understandable but also inconvenient. Also the chair was not very comfortable. All that being said, I will definitely be going back!",2.0

Service and atmosphere were all good. The restaurant is pretty small and has a bit of a rustic type of feeling to it.

Veal meatballs - 5/5 this is my favourite thing on the menu. Super tasty, eat this with the special hot pepper sauce they have. I think it s perfect.

Lamb shank - 3.5/5 a little bland at my most recent visit but still a good dish

Calamari - 4/5 pretty small portion but fresh

Pasta 4/5 I don t recall which of the 3 choices they have we got but you got could taste the fresh ingredients being used",2.0
22,"WHAT TO TRY?!

The Mexican corn!! I love their corn with that wonderful seasoning! The quesadillas are are also delicious too especially when it comes piping hot and the tortilla is lightly pan fried. The sauce is a great mix which makes it more flavourful. 

I liked the baja fried fish tacos the most out of all the tacos because it had the right combination of garnishes and the tortilla is corn over flour. The bulgogi taco was a bit too sweet for my liking tho. It is flavorful and full of sauce but the marinade they used for that taco may be too much. 

I also tried the avocado taco. It s a grilled quarter piece of avocado in the tortilla. I would have liked it if it wasn t that big of a chunk tho because although outside is grilled, inside is just plain old avocado. Having sliced a bit more thinner would have been nicer. 

The mushroom taco is a good vegetarian alternative for tacos and comes with great flavour. Lots of mushrooms but it s not some fancy mushrooms. Just regular mushrooms though. 

The asada, pork and chicken tacos are always a good staple to have for tacos. They are cooked with a lot of flavours which are great!

LAST TIP?!

They have water for free so if you are fine with water as a refreshment, then don t have to worry about ordering any other drinks. Quesadillas come with guacamole and chips on the side so no need to order more guacamole and chips as a snack! However tacos only come with chips, no complimentary guacamole - just something to keep in mind!",2.0
842,"Had a good dinner here last week! The interior is very traditional Italian and very cozy. Restaurant seems to be in an old house. There is a back patio as well a terrace on the third floor but we didn t get to check those out. 

The meal started with warm bread, we also got a caprese salad which i thought was just okay (tomatoes and basil weren t super fresh). My main was pappardelle with tomato sauce, shrimp and mushrooms. The best thing about the dish was how hot it was when it came out! It stayed hot for the entire time I was eating it which was awesome. I also loved the sauce which tasted very fresh and tomato-ey. The shrimp itself was kind of a letdown - it was a little overcooked and they also had the tails on which made it a little awkward to eat. Additionally, there seemed to be a couple pieces of shrimp shell in the pasta - the first time I ate a piece I thought it was maybe a tail I hadn t put off to the side but when it happened again I realized it was a piece of shell. My partner had the carbonara pasta which he said was just okay. For dessert we had tiramisu, it was delicious and a good portion for sharing. The meal was a little pricey, but everything is in Yorkville.

The service could have been better. We spent some time waiting to give our order and also to get water, and when the server did come by he seemed to be in a hurry. My partner felt bad since we d come in without a reservation, and he wondered if they needed the table - but if the restaurant didn t have room for us, it s their responsibility communicate that - either tell us they don t have a table available or that we need to leave by a certain time. (Neither of those things were mentioned when we were seated.) Our entire meal was just over an hour long so we certainly weren t taking an unusually long time to eat.

Overall the meal was fine but next time I ll probably try one of the other italian restaurants in the neighbourhood!",1.0

Why I was waiting in line, I got to watch the people inside hand made the noodle, that was so awesome and how much work that put in to have a yummy bowl of noodle.

961,"Finally came here on a Wednesday to try this unassuming fresh pasta place that I ve heard so much about! It s tucked into an industrial area that isn t easily accessible (was literally a 40-min subway ride from downtown Toronto), and nested between some buildings. It s actually located next to Dark Horse Espresso, which is likewise hidden. 

My friend came here earlier than 12PM (which is when it opens) to line up, so we didn t have to wait long. In fact, even when I arrived shortly after 12, there was a line forming, but it was only about 10 people. As we didn t want to wait further, we decided to get the pasta for takeout. Since we don t need to wait for inside seating in the tiny communal area, we were therefore able to get our order faster. 

The server taking orders was super friendly, and provided great service. He had a welcoming smile and warm tone, and was able to banter casually and really well with the customers. It s an open kitchen, so you re able to see the chefs make the pasta and cook your order. Super cool!

My friend and I placed one order each of their two daily specials, and waited for about ~5-10 minutes before our food was prepared. After getting some bread from the corner to sop the pasta sauce, we grabbed a seat outdoors and dug promptly into our food.

The pasta of the day was cavatelli, and it came with either a lighter rapini / anchovy / pecorini dressing or a richer sugo and sausage tomato sauce. The first one, con cime di rapa, was honestly so good! It had a nice flavour to it - slightly salty from anchovy, and the generous amount of greens really helped to brighten the dish. The cavatelli was perfectly al dente, though I did find some pieces to err on the side of being a little under-cooked. However, if I were to choose, I did prefer the tomato-based con sugo e salsiccia. It had more depth to it, and was just heartier! For $12, the pasta is a steal. The portions are also super generous, which is great (I had enough for the next day)!

Although we were able to save time from eating out, I would likely opt to eat-in next time. The experience is just better when you re dining on plates and not from a take-out container. Also, I found my pasta getting cold and hard even a couple minutes in, likely due to the wind and exposure from the air. It wasn t a perfect experience, but that just gives me more reason to come back! Looking forward to trying the cured meats, which looked so appetizing and delicious from afar....",2.0
772,"Stumbled upon this place while shopping on Queen West, we felt like Italian and hey look! Stelvio is right here! What timing.

I loved pretty much everything about this place: the decor, the service, and especially the food. I ve eaten at a LOT of Italian restaurants around the GTA and this place really stands above with the dishes on the menu, they are not like the usual offerings you see around here.

We tried the tagliatella with meat sauce, the sausage risotto, and started with the smashed potato appetizer (with onions, green beans, cheese and bacon). Literally every one of these dishes was amazing. 

My only complaint is that food took a while to come out, I found the seats very cramped and a bit uncomfortable by the end of our meal, and it was a lot louder in there than expected (though I blame this mainly on the loud couple next to us).

1539,"I can not stress how much i love this place enough! Located on dundas and spadina in dragon city mall, this place is a hidden gem!

Dumplings are one of my go to snacks or quick meals and i really like the takeout joint concept. It s an ideal place to grab a quick meal in-between classes whenever i have a long day.

The dumplings are so good, so fresh! My childhood favourite is the steamed xiao long bao and it still is today, and this place serves one of the best ones i ve had in downtown toronto. I ve also tried the pan fried soup dumplings (basically xiao long bao with a pan-fried bottom) and loved them! I ve been wanting to try more items from the menu but whenever I go here i always end up getting the xiao long bao for some reason.

They also have a wide range of sauces on the side so you can choose whatever you want to dip your dumplings in. Some of the condiments they provide are vinegar, soy sauce, and sriracha.

I also need to talk about the price. When i first went here, i was honestly so surprised when i saw the prices! They re super affordable (2.99 for 6 xiao long baos), which is a REALLY good deal especially in downtown toronto.",2.0

Be prepared to wait a bit to get in. This is a very small place and can be very busy especially during standard meal hours. The staff were friendly and super accommodating to us. They mainly have small tables but there are a few bigger ones. If you have a fairly large group of say more than 5 people you might want to reconsider if you all want to eat at once and sit together. This is great for small groups or even the solo diner. It was actually so busy when we went that we wound up sitting at a bigger table with other diners which was a lot of fun actually.

So definitely no complaints about the food at all, it s totally worth it but CASH ONLY! 

The only reason why I m giving it a 3 is because they don t have the best table service (which seemed to be the case in the Toronto Chinatown area). The waiting staff look really annoyed at you and the lack of hospitality is not what I m used to when I go to restaurants. Maybe the workers are being overworked and not compensated enough, just don t let it rub you the wrong way if you want to try the food, it does come out fast and I did really enjoy it.",1.0

Both areas are loud and roudy and give a great environment to hang, grab food and grab a drink with friends.

I got the infamous Mafalde Al Funghi which is basically their mushroom, truffle pasta! The shape of Mafalde is perfect for picking up the super delicious truffle cream sauce and making each bite so good as you soak in that savoury, creamy sauce. They could ve definitely plated the food better and I was originally skeptical when it arrived. But when I had it I was surprised how simple and elegant the dish was, yet it was so tasty. I wish the portions were bigger though for the $22 I had to pay!

They have their own house wine on tap for $1 per ounce! So it was $5 for a glass of wine, which is ridiculously cheap and it tasted pretty reasonable as well! (Another thing that resembles Italy! Cheap wine while you eat your meal!)

Tom yum soup - this was pretty solid with vibrant flavors and a good kick. Maybe I ve really lost spice tolerance but I was starting to drip before I was done with the cup...

Pad cha hett - mushroom stir fry. I got this with black rice just to try something new and it didn t quite fit the rest of the dish. If you get this, stick with the jasmine.

Drinks were so so good, I got the dragon fruit and watermelon cocktail and it tasted like juice but I could taste just the subtle flavour of hard liquor. 

Pasta was perfectly aldente and so much mushroom and truffle flavour, it brought me back to the truffle pasta I had in Florence. T Bone was great, flavour was really good and the addition of mushrooms was a nice touch to balance the strong flavour of steak.

879,"Debated long and hard on what rating to give; ultimately decided on a 3.5, but rounded downwards to a 3! Although I had a great time there with colleagues, it was really due to the company. The food was decent (neither spectacular nor amazing), but the service was, for the most part, non-existent. It took so long to flag someone down!

We had reserved a table for 10 at 6:30PM, and were seated in a private area, slightly hidden from the rest of the restaurant. To start, we ordered a selection of three salumi di mare. Don t be fooled! While many things here at Buca Yorkville are seafood-related, the salumi does contain some pork options. With the server s recommendation, we got the Soppressata di Polipo (octopus salami which therefore includes pork), Opah (cured moonfish), and I believe the Salmone Affumicato (smoked salmon). Accompanying this spread were gnocco fritto, fried squid ink dumplngs made with pork fat, and two small pieces of pickled onion. The smoked fish was the best and absolutely stole the show! It had a very rich and smoky flavour, and the saltiness whet my appetite. However, the other salumi were just okay.

A must order at Buca is the nodini - these small garlicky bread knots that are little bites of heaven! As my manager says, these are the ""yesdini"". We got two orders for the table, but as the knots disappeared in record time, we ordered another two portions. These nodini really stole the show!

We then ordered our own mains; I got the Polipo e Vongole. A small whole octopus came placed on top of some clams and crispy artichokes, with these al dente small pasta balls (the fregola sarda, which resembles couscous) soaking up the delicious broth. However, the octopus truly fell flat. It was soft, but lacked all flavour - it was bland, unseasoned, and just didn t stand out. For a main that costs $50, I was expecting something a bit more. My colleague ordered the risotto, and was very disappointed as well. It came in an extremely small and shallow bowl / plate, and he devoured it all in the matter of minutes. 

For dessert, we ordered two pairs of three desserts (from the four on the menu) to share:
Tiramisu - This dish barely resembled a tiramisu, and was more along the lines of a deconstructed dessert with a dark chocolate shell and mascarpone cream. It was interesting, but not what we were craving for and wanted.
Pizelle - This dessert stole the show, and was the best! The peach preserve and whipped cream made it appear deceivingly light (although you re well aware it s not, given all the dairy and richness). The presentation was also lovely; when the server poured the ganache over the top, the dessert was just imploring me to take photos!
Torta - I forgot the full name, but this chocolate hazelnut tart served with olive oil and squid ink just completely missed the mark. The olive oil imparted some savouriness to the dish, but the squid ink took it to a whole other level by adding some fishy essence. We left this largely untouched.

The wine assortment here is good, but also pricey (we paid ~$250 for a bottle of red, I believe). If I were to go to Buca again, I d likely go to the King location for more of the earthy and meaty pasta choices. While this location was decent, it simply didn t meet expectations.",1.0
1338,"Well my wife and I finally got around to try the new location of Khao San Road on Charlotte St. I love the decor and design of this location very interesting use of space, at first I thought there was only maybe room for about 20 people but as our server took us around the corner there was more seating for about another 20 to 30 people. The ambiance is really loud here and the back tables are mainly long high tops so plan to share with other people. 

The service is ok nothing too over the top but I give them a benefit of a doubt cause it was lunch time and it was full house and the servers were all running around. It didn t take long to flag our server down for some additional napkins, however our water glasses were empty and no one came around to refill until we asked. 

The food was ok as well we had ordered the Garlic Tofu and Garlic Chicken to start. Both appetizers were very crunchy and crispy the garlic taste was a bit muted in my opinion both also come with a ramekin of the typical Thai sweet chili dipping sauce. Very crunchy exterior which locked in all the juice inside.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prao with beef add $1 and fried egg add $1 which is basically a dry curry with beef, red peppers, onions, red and green chili peppers and also a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of white jasmine rice. I found that the beef was slightly too salty and too dry. Overall 3.5 / 5 for me. 

We also ordered the Khao Soi which is a soup noodle with egg noodles in a curry based soup. We opted to get the beef option for an additional $1. The presentation was really nice flavours were good slightly on the sweet side for my liking but when lime juice is added the flavour sort of balanced itself out. I think this is a 4 / 5 for me.

Overall just another Thai restaurant in the city that serves authentic Thai food. But didn t really blow me away.

758,"Queen West small Italian shop with simple black and white d cor, sizeable patio but limited seating inside, typical (you ll get the joke soon) Italian fair with a slight focus on risottos and pastas.

I thought just the d cor was black and white, but it turned out the placemats and menus were also black and white - there s a collection of black ink art that reminds me of medieval times when artists worked for months on a simple line drawing to get things just right - whether it was embellishment in a single capital letter, or a decorative flower, or the skull of an animal - because you know, all these are completely related and belong side by side. Nothing wrong with it at all, it was definitely unique and presented artfully. 

The menu is deceptively lengthy - dishes are in Italian then described in English. I ve never read a menu that uses ""typical"" as it s adjective of choice so much. Most of my party went for pastas - they were smaller portions than desired. It would ve been fine as a lunch portion, but for dinner it was insufficient and taste was simpler than expected (or should I say, typical?). The risotto with veal was actually a highlight despite some other reviews and the portion was actually filling, unlike the gnocchi and ravioli items (those were the smallest!). Overall it was really not bad - but unfortunately underwhelming.

Service is very slow if you re a large group - so please spare them and only come with a few friends. You ll enjoy the ambiance more and sharing more items will be more feasible, and your overall experience will just be that much better! If I m in the area I suppose I could give it another shot, but for one that values taste over aesthetic, I might not be back.",1.0
554,"This year has really started off well for me (at least in terms of food haha)

King Tacos is a family-run Mexican restaurant on St. Clair West. We ordered Gaucamole, Chicken Tacos and Beef Bistec Tacos. 

You do get free fresh chips and sauces with all orders, which I think is super! 

The whole concept is amazing. You get FRESH tacos in a taco box, you assemble it yourself, which I think is nice. You also get 3 different sauces to add to your tacos and you can add cheese too! 

It s very authentic and similar to how it is in Mexico! It s quite a large restaurant with lots of seating. The only thing I would say it as it s family run, it s a little slow. They re definitely hospitable and friendly but the service is a little slow, even for a weekend lunch. I won t ding them for this because the flavours of everything we ordered was scrumptious. Large portions don t hurt either ;)",2.0

Before we knew it we were seated on the back patio. 

We each ordered a couple of tacos and they were nicely done. I really enjoyed my Hongos taco. Perfectly rolled and dressed; crispy and well presented on a thin rectangular plate. 

We were going to leave it at that, but the desert really grabbed us. 

So- 10 years ago I fell in love with avocado gelato. It s really good but I ve only seen it made at one gelato place that has long been out of business. Anyhow, my wife was really excited to spot that on the menu, there it was!!! Avocado gelato. Served with churros and sauce. Yummm. So good. Highly recommended.

Service was great from start to finish, attentive and overall a good experience. However, the food was decent at best. The Cacio e Pepe was on the saltier side, so be ready for that. It was very rich in flavour, a pinch less of salt and this would be been wonderful. The charcuterie board was decent, although I must say that the cheese was really good.

1465,"I suppose that the price is expected since it is located on King St. W near all these theatres in the heart of the financial district, but it was still quite pricy for the amount of food that they give.

The size of an order of white rice alone was a third of the typical full round bowl of rice in most other Chinese restaurants yet here it costs $2 simply because how it s presented in small wooden steam baskets.

If you are going for a play nearby like my beau and I were or a financier working nearby or maybe going on a downtown date, then this would be the ideal Asian fusion cuisine you will go to. It is classy enough without being downright expensive.

Location: 4/5

It is right next to the Royal Alexandria Theatre or across from the Roy Thompson Hall, a bit west of St. Andrew s Station. So many things nearby to do and see before or after having a meal here.

Decor/Ambience: 4/5

It is located in the basement and parts of the restaurant is dim, but there are small lights here and there on both the ceiling and on the sides of the wall. They have two huge round tables at the back that when not reserved by a large group of people, singles or pairs of individuals would be sitting around the table during busy hours. Otherwise, they have tables for twos and fours scattered throughout the restaurant and a lovely little enclosed area that can be reserved. Red flowers and red lanterns decorated the space and gave it warmth. Since it s neither too dark or too bright inside, each table felt secluded enough for conversations to mingle and intertwine of the buzzling backdrop.

Food quality: 4.5/5

My Thai green curry shrimp with spaghetti was superb! The flavours were incredibly full bodied. Plenty of veggies especially peppers and red onions and the curry was just amazing! The spaghetti was not enough alone to soak in all of that rich flavour or oozing liquid, so I had to order a bowl of white rice. They gave 7 tiger shrimps that tasted great alone or dipped with the curry.

My beau ordered Szechuan style shrimps and scallops and his was spicier than mine and even bolder in flavours. 
Both styles of shrimps had us smacking our lips and licking the sauce from our fingers. The scallops were sizeable and I definitely enjoyed the meaty texture.

The quality of food is totally there, so I will definitely come back when I am nearby again.

Their menu is quite extensive actually, so I am sure there will be plenty of other food options that I can order for my next meal here before a musical or the likes.

Service: 3.5/5

Pretty standard, but they refilled our water without having to be asked and they served our dishes rather quickly, so we were in and out within 40 minutes, including the time waiting to be seated and getting the bill. Not bad. 

I think most items are meant to be shared, but we are used to having individual dishes each. 

Value: 4/5

Expected price due to the location. Food quality is above average but not the best. I would not say that it tasted all that authentic, but that is again to be expected of Asian fusion restaurant. It certainty has a nice mix of flavours and food options, so my beau and I can certainly see ourselves coming back. Hopefully, we will order something more satisfying though next time that includes rice or more spaghetti, cause $2 for that small amount of rice as photoed made me raise my eyebrows.",2.0
1431,"Delicious experience and the chef s ability to execute on Chinese fusion is totally on point. 

To me, this place told the perfect story of childhood nostalgia and modern French cuisine.

We made reservations via telephone, but you could also do so on OpenTable. 

Service was fantastic and ours really knew is stuff when telling us about the dish being served. 

Wife & I ended up going with the Dailo s Choice chef s tasting menu ($65 pp) and were not disappointed! We asked if we could have a few must-have items as part of it, and they were happy to accommodate! Amazing!

To me, the most memorable & nostalgic dish was dessert. It was a Pandan and, wait for it, WHITE RABBIT CANDY icecream with tumeric crisps and some sponge cake. Apparently it was the winner of an internal dish challenge amongst the cooks 2 days ago and it totally blew our minds! Amazing for them to do this and so glad they did!

The amuse bouche was some sort of soup with sesame oil, while don t remember what it was exactly, was so flavourful to start the meal!

Other dishes that were very notable and highly recommend are octopus tacos, truffle fried rice with homemade XO sauce (the XO sauce is amazing), fried watermelon (something unique and yummy), smoked duck platter (so many different flavours & textures!), Melt in your mouth pork hock, and their interpretation of turnip cakes.

All in all, delicious experience and really enjoyed the tasting menu.

Our order was assembled quickly. The lady who took our order also threw in a cheese enchilada for us to try, which was so lovely!

My only feedback is to step up their service. When the server brought out our food, I asked for parmesan cheese and crushed peppers. She said there is already ""a lot"" of parmesan cheese on there, walked away and came back with only crushed pepper??

We ordered the anniversary prix fixe, signature sushi selection platter, beef carpaccio and tuna tartare. The prix fixe was OK.. quantity wise this one is actually worth the price as you get a lot of courses, but only the sashimi stood out as it was delicious and so fresh that it melted in my mouth! The sashimi is my favourite dish out of the ENTIRE meal... none of our other dishes stood out at all.. they did not taste fresh and to be honest, very bland. The beef carpaccio had barely any sauce on it but for some reason, had such a strong and weird after taste that my partner only managed 2 bites LOL. I ve dined at many sushi restaurants and have had way better quality and fresh sushi for less than half the price at Miku..

Service was pretty good. Our server was very sweet, made sure our waters were always filled and checked up on us a few times. It was just a bit hard to understand her when she was explaining the food items due to her accent but its not too big of a deal..

First off, it was packed at 7pm on a Friday but my dad and I were able to get the perfect table out on the front patio. Our waitress was really nice and, although she had a lot of tables she was looking after, made good recommendations.

By far the favorite thing I ate here was the warm mushroom arugula salad, which was recommended to us by our waitress (instead of the caprese salad). It was so good that I m still dreaming about it today. The mushrooms were salty and lemony and they coated the greens and warmed them up nicely.

For our entree, we decided to split a pasta and a pizza. Note from me: skip the pizza! Our ""marguerite"" pizza was just a very cheesy mess. It tasted better next day. It was nothing like a pizza marguerite (and does not look like the ones posted previously on yelp). The pasta we had was one of the special ones, and I can t remember the name. Kind of like half moon raviolis. It was good, but man the sauce was great! Next time I d say get an appetizer and then maybe 2 pastas to split ... but skip the pizza for sure.

178,"Rating: This is a solid 3 1/2* with the bump of 1/2* for the circumstance of my visit. 

I had this place bookmarked for a while but a recent review by a fellow Yelper (shout-out to Sammie S.) made me realize that I was walking by Campechano on my way for lunch to a different place. 

So what was I to do? 
I decided to get a smaller dish at the lunch place in order to stop at Campechano for a few tacos. Luckily, I have a wife and daughter that humours me in my food pursuit. 

We arrived just after 2pm and the waitress informed us that the last call will be in 15 minutes as they close at 2:30pm. That was no problem since I was the only one interested in ordering something. This is a small place and I could see seating being an issue at busier times. Love their wall mural. 

The wait staff quickly provided us with a menu. I was disappointed that there was no shrimp tacos for lunch. So I decided to order the Bistec (Top Sirloin) and the Tinga de pollo (Chicken Breast). There s no way you could just order one taco even though you kind of full. 

The tacos came out fairly quick as you can see it being cooked in front of you as they have an open kitchen. I liked the Tinga the best. Both of the tacos had the Morita sauce which provided a nice little kick but the Bistec was overtly salty. Also the prices are a little steep but based on location, I can understand why. 

My dining experience at Campechano probably took no more than 10 minutes plus it was right before closing. That s why I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and bump up the rating to 4*. I m hoping to come back for dinner and ask if they offer shrimp tacos. 

Solid tacos but not the best in the GTA.

326,"Great: food, ambiance and the staff s attitude
Could be better: The service 

The food here is excellent. Our favourite was the churros--best I ve ever had and large enough to share with 2-3 people. The fajitas and quesadilla were perfect and made with fresh ingredients. Guacamole was tasty, but more creamy rather than chunky. For a drink, I tried the mango mojito and it was delicious, but the alcohol seemed to be light and a double shot would be recommended.

I saw some people share the portions were small and menu items expensive, but need to point out the food here is shareable and ordering multiple items for the table is encouraged. Two tacos (under $10) is pretty filling for an average person, especially if you get an appetizer to share with someone.

58,"Two words can summarize my thoughts on the food here: overpriced and bland. I was super stoked to try Como En Casa because (1) I LOVE Mexican food and (2) fellow Yelpers have given this place such glowing reviews. We placed a takeout order on a Friday night. I ordered a small chicken burrito and my husband ordered a large verde burrito with beef. When I called and placed the order on the phone, the person asked me ""if guacamole was okay"". I said yes. To my chagrin, the guacamole was an extra charge, and we ended up paying nearly $30 for two burritos. I recognize that it s partly my fault for not checking if guacamole was extra, but I thought the way that I was asked suggested it was included, and they were asking if I wanted it on my burrito. Just seemed kind of slimy, if you ask me. 

All of this (including the high-ish price tag) would have been fine if I enjoyed my burrito. Negative. The meat was incredibly dry and bland. I barely had any chicken in my burrito, and if I did manage to snag some meat, it tasted like chewy old chicken. The burrito was mostly rice with, like, one piece of lettuce. I barely tasted a tomato or anything to break up the rice. I didn t notice any beans or sour cream. Honestly, this was a terrible burrito. I think I m pretty easy to impress with Mexican food, but this was just horrible. My husband didn t like his either. I won t be wasting my precious Friday-night cheat meal on this place.",0.0

When I got here around 6:30pm, it was fairly empty but filled up pretty quickly.

I ordered the Carne pizza. It was a good pizza and I ended up taking some home for lunch tomorrow. The crust was crispy and I guess it was the sausage that had a bit of a bite.

I paid my bill and was finishing up my wine, getting ready to go. Then one of the servers asked if I would move to the patio to a high top chair because they needed my table. I said I wasn t going to be much longer and didn t want to move to a high top (I have a wonky knee). About ten seconds later, the second server came over and asked me to move and I told her the same thing. About five minutes later, one of the servers said I really had to leave because they really needed my table. I just had a sip of wine left and again said I d be leaving shortly (and did). I felt a bit uncomfortable because the table next to mine was looking over and wondering what was going on.

So what started out being a pleasant meal got ruined. I understand that a small restaurant needs to turn the tables over to make money. But if the table was reserved and I needed to be gone by 7:30pm (so in about an hour), they should have said so when I was seated so the expectations were set ... rather than kicking me out because someone else needed the table.

The soup is so appetizing that you d want to finish the whole bowl - including the soup. You are free to choose the type of noodle/meat you like which I think it s a plus. I personally love the chewiness of the wonton noodles. There s also chili sauce available on the side. Overall food portion is sufficient - just enough that you will still be able to work after.

The food and drinks were just as amazing as the ambience though. We ordered a regular and mango margarita. Super good...especially because the mango margarita was actual mango pur e and not a syrup. 

The food is served more tapa style, but the specials and tacos could be big enough portions if you aren t super hungry. We ordered the table side guacamole and tuna tostada..both great. For entrees we ordered the quesadilla (I know it sounds weird..but it sounded to amazing to pass up) and the shrimp tacos. Both so so so good!

Had the queso fundido which was decent but not great, not hot enough so the cheese was already hardening up, chorizo was bland, also a small portion with only four tortillas for twelve dollars.
The elotes were ok, nothing special. One cob cut in thirds.
The tacos though were really disappointing. Had a fish, a calamari, and a cactus. Three for fifteen dollars was the deal. The fish and calamari were tiny nuggets of tasteless breaded frozen seafood, the nopales tasted like they were straight out of a can. They were all bizarrely garnished with two cucumber half-moons, the fish was garnished with the usual cabbage slaw. 
The two salsas provided were the best part of the meal.
The service was inattentive at best, water was never refilled, waiters were wandering around aimlessly with salsas and dishes, not knowing where they were going. Never were asked how the food was or if we needed anything.

Restaurant isn t too big, and they really only have a couple of tables, i think with the largest table seating 8? Menu is also fair in size, but they have Sunday brunch if you re interested in eggs rather than tacos! We came here specifically for their tacos and salsa bar! 

Hostess/waitress was great in explaining their menu to us. They have 2 types of tacos: Gourmet and Street taco. Gourmet tacos are two tortillas stuffed with cheese in between and then their taco ingredients on top. Street tacos are your typical tacos but with only 1 tortilla. We opted to try one of each. I had the seafood gourmet taco (fish, squid and shrimp) with slaw on top and also the beef street taco. The beef street taco is AMAZING. So flavourful and filled with onions and cilantro on top!! The seafood gourmet taco was good but was nothing overly special in my opinion. My hubby got the rotisserie chicken taco and that was SOOO good. I was first skeptical because rotisserie chicken and tacos together didn t sound appealing, but the sauce, the ingredients, the toppings all combined so well together. Mind you they are not stingy on their meats. They give you a heaping amount and you get really full after one gourmet taco!! The waitress also recommended their churros as they are homemade and lightly dusted with cinnamon. We tried the chocolate filled churro and it was sooooo goood. it comes out pipping hot and with chocolate oozing out. 

Service was also fast and great. They also serve free nacho chips and a help yourself salsa bar which was fun! They had salsa ranging from mild to really spicy. and also had this jalapeno guac that was my fav. I can t wait to return and try their other options!!",2.0
1887,"Lets face it, dim sum can be a stressful experience. The waiting, crowds, loud noises and rushed service can all be off-putting. It may be a big price to pay for those delicious Chinese tapas that we call dim sum.

Some may argue these unpleasantries are part of the quintessential dim sum experience, but I disagree. I don t like crowds and I don t like noise, so typically I stay away from dim sum. Lai Wah Heen is an exception to the typical Dim Sum experience.

Dim sum at Lai Wah Heen is more like a High Tea experience. It s mostly calm and soothing. The service is impeccable with attentive uniformed waiters. The ambiance is upscale with white tablecloth and minimal ambient noise. 

It s pricier than average dim sum. True. But you get what you pay for. All the dishes are very good. The clay pot eel rice is delicious as is the steamed bean curd sheet wrapped with mushrooms. My gf s favorite dish was the steamed chicken with fish maw in rice wine sauce.

Now that my mother lives in condominium close by, Lai Wah Heen may be my new go-to for some ""peaceful"" dim sum. It may be more expensive, but it s worth it in my opinion, since I only get dim sum occasionally.",2.0

The restaurant itself is a sight to behold with aquariums all around the dining area filled with massive king crabs and lobsters, fish, eels, and other seafood. The dishes are cooked family-style with many different options and most people opt for the crab/lobster mountain with fried garlic - a choice you can t go wrong with! The crustaceans are also broken down and served in several courses such as crab legs crisped shallots and chilies, and decadent fried with the body meat. 

The menu has a variety of different combos and you can also customize it according to your group with the help of the staff. They also bring out the massive lobsters and crabs for you to take pictures with which is always fun.

Prices are up there but it s seafood and can be managed by customizing your combos. 

Highly recommend and make sure to make reservations!",2.0
1430,"We happened upon DaiLo during a visit to Toronto and it easily became my favorite meal of the trip. Everything on the menu looked incredible so we opted for the six-course tasting menu. 

Texture was at the forefront of this meal; every dish had a lovely dynamic of ingredients. We started with a bite of squash soup and a betel leaf with puffed rice. We then had the octopus tacos (must get!), which were wrapped in a thin slice of jicama instead of tortillas. That was followed by a delicious soup with scallop ceviche -- I wanted to drink the broth. Pea dumplings with truffles were exquisite. The beef with gnocchi wasn t a highlight for me but still was a solid dish. The meal finale was an entire fried trout with a zesty salad. I normally would have been too intimidated to order such a dish, but this was spectacular. 

For ~$60, this was an incredible value, with every single dish being quite impressive and unique. Service was excellent, I really appreciated that each dish was explained as it came out. Would 100% return.",2.0
1005,"Eataly is located in the Manulife Centre at the south east corner of Bay and Bloor. 

What at this point most likely takes the largest footprint of this facility, it may have been Ashley before the major renovation. Eataly Toronto is like Eataly Flatiron approximately fifty thousand square feet. That s quite a footprint considering this is on multiple levels in an uptown location of Bloor-Yorkville. For Eataly though you need a large footprint to be able to house multiple food counters, restaurants, full blown grocery options, walls of products and a place for cooking classes. 

For those that don t know Eataly is basically a huge Italian superstore. This store may not have everything you re looking for that is Italian in that they don t have Ferarri or Lamborghini for sale but they do have prosciutto from Modena and many other places for that matter. Looking for Grana Padano or Reggio Parmigiana? Will a wheel do? The guy working the cheese counter said somebody came in and bought half a wheel cut lengthwise for a wedding just the other day. 

While the place doesn t have Santa Maria Novella like the NYC Flatiron store they do have on premise made beer at the birroteca on the concourse level. Using Italian hops and other ingredients Eataly Toronto has the only on premise brewery of all the Eataly establishments so that s sort of special.

I had out of town guests and while my wife has been to Eataly Toronto already I had not been so my first visit was going to be with the out of towners. We spent quite a bit of time at the olive oil wall as they were trying samples and deciding which to get. My wife picked one she knew she wanted without trying any samples. My friends tried a variety and eventually bought one and also a bottle of balsamic to go with it. My friends ended up getting fresh ravioli nearby as well.

It was mid afternoon on a Friday and the pasta and Neapolitan pizza restaurants had some seating but we were already going to eat a few hours later at a place we made reservations for earlier in the day. I noticed the Roman style pizza bar was quite popular and a quicker option. I had the Roman pizza in the Eataly in Century City and I prefer it to the Neapolitan actually. I like the crunch and the variety of slices I can get in one sitting and while Neapolitan doesn t take very long to make the Roman slices are ready.

Overall Eataly is overwhelming. While I ve been to 3 others (NYC - Flatiron, Chicago, LA - Century City) I found Toronto s to be as good as at least Flatiron but less streamlined. Toronto s version is more like an Ikea gauntlet that makes you go through the entire store to say get to the gelato bar. At Flatiron and Chicago the Lavazza and gelato can be accessed at the first floor level without having to go all the way in. The Toronto setup has the caf type areas in the area on the upper level facing Bloor where there s the pasta/pizza area, bar, coffee/dessert stand, Roman pizza all in a corner.

The content of Eataly Toronto is basically all there in an unfamiliar footprint albeit still somewhat organized. I like this concept and I ll be back to try the other offerings like the pizza and pasta.",2.0

I used to pass by this place all the time but rarely ever went in until a few years ago when I dined here with some friends. Since that day I have been coming here way too often and I consider this place to be my go to in Chinatown when I crave Chinese food.

The menu here is huge and it ranges from the BBQ pork/roast duck hanging in the window to fried rice/noodles/congee to seafood and much more. With so many options it is always difficult to make up my mind what to order however I do have some go to dishes when I simply can t make up my mind. My first recommendation is the ginger and onion lobster which is my personal favourite style of lobster. The sauce on this is just delicious and it is always fun getting your hands dirty cracking those shells open. The fried turnip cake is also good here as I like the lightly crisped skin with a hint of spiciness. You also cannot go wrong ordering noodles here but my personal favourite is the ho fun with beef and black bean sauce.

Service here is efficient and casual in a good way. The staff here treat you like a friend speaking informally and occasionally cracking jokes. Everyone is friendly and food gets to your table super fast.

The space itself is fairly spacious with a lot of seating. If you come by yourself or in a pair though they may ask you to share a large table with other strangers (it is optional) so do not be surprised if they ask.

House of Gourmet has become my go to whenever I am in Chinatown and want a casual meal. Note that this place can get loud when it is busy with the chattering of people and dishes clanking so definitely not a good spot if you want a quiet meal. Otherwise it is perfect if you want a lively environment with good food.",2.0

2. TACOS: 
- Baja fish Taco 10/10. The fish was nicely fried in a batter. My fave out of all the tacos tried.
- Tacos de Chorizo 10/10. The spicy chopped sausage was bomb!
- Tacos de Tinga 8/10. Flavour was a bit off for me. The chicken was nicely cooked though.

Service was spotty, it was the end of the night we were one of the last tables to walk in, understandable. The basis were covered but wasn t anything spectacular. 

Ordered 3 dishes, truffle fried rice, dry aged ribeye, and the beef tataki/tartare..? cant remember. 

truffle fried rice was PACKED with umami flavour and the side xo sauce enhanced the rice to a new level, I should ve asked for more of the it. 

dry aged ribeye steak was also tender as fffffffff, cooked perfect medium rare and pre-cut just the way I like it. Sauce on top was alright a little too tangy and sour for the girlfriend, I didn t mind it but could ve had it on the side and wouldn t have cared about it either. 

the beef tartare or whatever it was, wasn t too memorable would ve rather had a different app but wasn t a bad dish either, 3/5.

I must have passed by this place for a very very long time but did not know anything about it until recently. The restaurant is on the second floor of one of the buildings on Dundas and aside from the big hanging sign outside I did not really notice it was there. After finally trying this place I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner.

The menu was fairly extensive and ranged from lighter options such as sandwiches to HK style milk tea to pork chop rice. The best way to describe the food at Hong Kong Cafes would be filling, inexpensive comfort food. There were several items I wanted to order but decided on the pork chop with tomato sauce and rice (you have the option of rice or spaghetti). The waitress also brought me a bowl of hot soup to start which was great. When my rice arrived I was happily surprised at the portion size and how delicious the food looked. I quickly dug in and was very pleased with the taste of the food. The tomato sauce was plentiful and a bit sour like I prefer and the pork chop was nice and crispy on the outside. It was an enjoyable meal and I was stuffed when I was finished with the food.

The service was good here as the staff were all friendly and checked in on me often. Many of the people that came in seemed to be regulars so there was a lot of friendly chit chat between the customers and the staff which gave the place a friendly vibe.
The restaurant itself is not overly big but offers a fair amount of seating. The place feels clean and the seats were comfortable.

I had the tinga de pollo and barbacoa. I m not sure it s necessary to break down the ingredients as many are familiar with Mexican food. They key is that the food quality and preparation are exceptional here. It s hard to avoid cliches such as ""texture"" ""fully seasoned"" ""done right"" ""full of flavour"" when describing the food here, but that s exactly how my experience was. They are clearly using great ingredients, even down to the tortillas which are better than most places. As they say ""good food makes good food"".

I came in for brunch/lunch on a Saturday around 1PM with my friend. We were seated basically right away which was nice. I personally don t really like how all the tables & chairs are super tall, makes me feel a little unstable. The backrests for the chairs were also really small, so you don t have full back support & cant lean comfortably (though still better than no back rests at all).
The server was really nice and explained the menu options nicely; most people come and get the strappazette but I wanted to try something different.
I ended up getting a soupy type of dish with poached eggs & it was honestly SO AMAZING. It s meant for dipping your bread, and it was so rich with taste and texture I was blown away. The bread is also super delicious with just the right amount of crisp and fluffy and LOADS of butter/oil, I ended up having to buy more bread ($2) because my starting ratio was too much bread with not enough of the soup.
Honestly, I was so focused on how amazing my dish was I forgot about my friends... she said hers was good though! I think she got the croccanti, which had fried eggs and some bread as well.
Our server had forgotten about the extra bread I had ordered because it started getting busy and she needed to go to the bar. We had to ask other servers for the bread, twice, and also for more water.

We had a mixed plate of spicy (mouth numbing) beef, tripe, etc... so delicious. One of my favourite dishes!

The handmade noodles. I can eat a plate of these noodles with anything on the menu. It went really well with the sauces from my aforementioned dishes.

The lamb skewer was seasoned nicely with cumin and whatever else they use. The meat was tender with just a bit of fat. We didn t mind it at all.

We over ordered with one additional dish. We had a braised lamb dish served on naan. I found the bread too heavy and would ve preferred it to be served separately. 

I ll admit, I m still not a fan of the VIP card concept. You do save on every single dish whether it be $1 or $4.

1776,"Dim sum in the heart of Yorkville, honestly coming from Richmond Hill (read: right beside Markham!) I wasn t expecting much. I expected average, bland tasting classics like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork bites wrapped in wonton-like skin). We arrived as a table of 7 on a weekday and the place was fairly empty - understandable, dim sum usually is a longer meal not favoured for a workday lunch hour. We ordered a bit of everything and some of us were looking for specific items - everyone found what they were looking for! There were a decent variety and many classics on the menu - some that aren t often found even in Markham because they re complex to make and don t sell for high prices.

The highlights were the fritter wrapped in rice roll, the osmanthus cake, and the mini octopus in curry sauce. Often the rice rolls are squishy and lack texture, but this one was a good consistency that complemented the crunchy (not chewy!) dough fritter. The osmanthus cake came with a base layer of coconut milk, providing additional flavour and texture that agreed with the table s demands for desserts that re not too sweet but still *something*. We also ordered steamed sponge cake - it was soft and fluffy, steaming hot. The realization the sponge cake was steamed baffled some, and the softness and light flavour was well received. It could ve had more of the signature taste, but it was a decent attempt at the classic.

Overall for the location I was pleasantly surprised, and prices were aligned to the area as well. Unfortunately from a dim sum in Toronto perspective, I didn t feel like it was anywhere close to great and it definitely wasn t worth the price paid. Service was good and accommodating to the non-Chinese speakers, but translations were odd and made it more difficult to understand what things were in some cases.

HK cafes (cha chaan tengs) serve low cost Canto-Western cuisine and this is a result of Britain s colonization of Hong Kong and as a result it ended up impacting the food served.

I have been to a Hong Kong Bistro Cafe a few times and dropped by recently on a late Friday afternoon during the holiday season. I ordered the lunch special which was a baked grouper in a tomato sauce over a bed of spaghetti, it also came with a soup (choice of Chinese soup, cream soup and Russian Borscht which is essentially a tomato soup) and a HK milk tea for $8.50 plus tax. The spaghetti was pretty basic but the baked grouper was cooked perfectly, really well done. The Russian borscht (tomato soup) soup was basic and the HK milk tea was above average.

So many choices. I had the BBQ pork and duck rice, wonton noodles, fried noodles and fish congee. They re famous for their freshly made noodles in soup or lo mein amongst their rice and congee dishes.

For today s standards, the quantity is fairly sizeable and the price is right. Can t go wrong here. This place opens late, caters to locals and tourists, can speak (broken) English and is considered clean (and new) for old Chinatown. Definitely worth visiting if you re in the area.",2.0
33,"My favourite Mexican fast food restaurant! By fast food, I mean you order and pay upfront (with no tip necessary) and they will bring the food when ready.

Seating is limited so sharing the table with others is needed. However given it is fast food restaurant, a lot of people choose to grab and go instead. The deco is very friendly and has the casual Mexican vibe. 

Last time I was here I ordered the $4.5 classic taco. It came with chips that you can dip in a varieties of free salsa (some spicy, some refreshing and none to complain about) and hot sauce. I think it is good value and quite tasty. However the lady who we shared the table with ordered the Fajita, a ""sizzling"" skillet that is worth being jealous over. 

So when we went there tonight, I did not hesitate to order the chicken Fajita and wow it did not disappoint. The skillet was sizzling hot when presented. You can hear the sizzling sound and smelled amazing. The chicken is flavourful with some peppers and onion. The chicken by itself could have been too oily or too salty but the skillet came with taco bread, guacamole (amazingly fresh and probably made in store) and fresh lettuce. I was really impressed by this dish and definitely became one of my favourite.

I think this place could be busy sometime and the wait time would be long. But with food this good (and free salsa), I think it is worth the wait. I will definitely will go back :)",2.0
1828,"This was our first Chinatown experience and it left much to be desired. I ll start by saying that the menu is extensive, with over 160 items to choose from. Perhaps we didn t order the best dishes.

We ordered the soup dumplings with crab meat and pork, which were the highlight of the night. Both the Sui Mai and the chicken and cabbage potsticker, which were on special, did not hit home. They were both bland and could have used some salt. The last dish, stir fried Ho Fun with beef was good but the beef had an interesting texture, it had no chew and fell apart in your mouth. I d say the noodles had good flavour but could have been better.

To sum up, the food was good. It wasn t great, it wasn t bad... it was good. The service was great. Food came quickly and servers were always nearby. If I do come back to this location, the soup dumplings are the only thing that I will be ordering again.",1.0
752,"Almost a full restaurant on a Monday? They must be doing something right!

I came in here with the SO for dinner, and it was lively to say the least! We were seated promptly. The ambience is a lovely combination of rustic with modern elements. 

We ordered a couple of arancini balls, and the trout crudo to start. And a couple of pasta dishes - amatriciana and turkey tagliatelle. 

House bread with olive oil - Just perfect way to start. 
Arancini - Crunchy on the outside, soft and cheesy on the inside with a beautiful tomato sauce. Probably one of the best I ve had. 
Trout Crudo - It s a delicate dish! I should have eaten this before the arancini... and saved some bread. oh well...
Amatriciana and Tagliatelle - Perfectly al dente paired with balanced sauces. If you are craving pasta, you are at the right place. 

The cocktails looked great, but I didn t drink this time. I ll have to make a trip down here again - maybe in the summer for the patio!",2.0
1368,"Miku is a stylish and upscale sushi spot near the waterfront great for that special occasion. The place s self-proclaimed specialty is aburi sushi or flame grilled sushi which is indeed the highlight of the sushi menu. They offer a sampler of all the types of aburi sushi, which is 2 pieces each of the three different types of aburi sushi. If you re at all a sushi lover I would highly recommend trying them! The rolls are decent as well, although not particular too remarkable. The sashimi was fresh and presented nicely as well.

you re not a sushi lover, in which case I d probably recommend going to a different style of Japanese restaurant, but luckily some of their entrees, in particular the sablefish is delicious. 

Overall the restaurant is a nice spot for a fancy sushi occasion in an upscale location. The service was good, and the kitchen staff was actually rather accommodating for dietary restrictions and willing to make changes. However I would say that for the price, even for upscale sushi spots in a city like Toronto, you can probably get a more unique and memorable sushi experience elsewhere, which is what keeps me from giving them one more star.",2.0
1377,"I came here for my birthday celebration. It was a surprise, so I was super excited when we stopped by this place. As we walked in, you walk up a very instagram-able set of stairs. We were greeted promptly, and offered coat-check.

We got a table by the live piano. The piano playing added a nice ambience to our dinner. But I found the piano a little bit too loud at times, so it was hard to hear my date talk. But I did enjoy how he would play to the age group of the crowd. I didn t enjoy my sofa seat that much because it was too low for me to eat properly. It sank in a lot as well. 

Our server explained the menu to us, and recommend that we share a steak and order two to three sides. 

We ordered:
14oz Creekstone Farm Prime Black Angus rib eye - medium rare $91
Table Side Caesar Salad - $26 
Mushroom Risotto - $26
Duck Fat Fries - $17 

Each table started with their house made brioche - which was crispy on the outside and fluffy and hollow on the inside. It also came with their garlic butter, which was buttery goodness. 

Then came the Caesar Salad. The salad was more of a show where the severs would roll a cart of ingredients for the salad to your table and make it in front of you. It was a nice touch to see them make everything from scratch. The salad maker didn t really talk to us or try to make conversation so it was a little disappointing. (I saw the table next to us have a full on conversation with their salad maker).

The salad was good, but not the best caesar salad I ever had. It was a nice balance of cheese, and smoked bacon and a hint of anchovies. If you aren t the biggest fan of anchovies, you can ask for it on the side. I did find it a bit fishy at times. 

Next, came the steak, which was cooked to perfection. I ve never had such a tender and perfectly cooked steak. It was charred on the outside on an iron skillet. The steak came with charcoal salt, herbed salt, and pink salt (super fancy). All the salts tasted the same, salty. The steak also came with a chimichurri sauce, blue cheese and yuzu shoyu. I enjoyed the blue cheese the most. The salts and the blue cheese, brought out the beef flavour. Hands down, this is one of the best steaks I ve ever had.

The risotto was good as well. My date didn t enjoy it as much, but I didn t mind it. But, if given another opportunity, we probably would have gotten something else.

The duck fat fries were amazing. Who would have thought fries could be cooked this nicely. Every fry had a good ratio of crispiness and fluffiness. The fries came with two sauces, their house ketchup and a garlic mayo. 

We didn t get dessert, but the restaurant gives you a small tasting of their dessert free of charge. We got a small chocolate and a macaron. On the way out, they also give you chocolate muffins as a take-away. This was a nice touch.

Jacob s is definitely a fancier place. From the service, to the ambiance, decorations and even the bathroom, they make sure your visit is enjoyable. The server made sure to check up on us every so often, the water s were always filled, and our napkins were always folded if we left the seat. The elderly gentleman, at the entrance, even insisted in helping me wear my jacket - even after I refused (I gave in). 

I would like to come back and try their other steaks. There is a Wagyu Steak that costs $880 - out of my price range, but this gives you an idea of the type / quality of steaks they have.",2.0
933,"The service was spectacular! Really! You guys impressed me with the level of attention and care. 10/10! What disappointed me was the ratio of quality to the price of food. I paid $26 for the seafood linguine and there were 2 tiny scallops and 3 shrimps. Not good value for the money in my opinion. Grazie on Yonge, in contrast, offers better value for the money. Their prices are lower as well. My wife liked the gnocchi she ordered, but there was no promised gorgonzola cheese. She could not taste it. The organic wine, on the other hand, was fantastic! She loved it! The calamari appetizer was DELICIOUS! Overall, a mixed bag of FANTASTIC service and mediocre value for the money when it comes to pasta. Next time, I ll go for pork chop or lamb. I m tired of gluten and carbohydrates. I prefer protein + veggies and some legumes.",2.0
1894,"We regularly order through a delivery app and I m yet to be disappointed. Price point is a bit higher, but I know I m getting quality food so I ll pay. Dim sum and Chinese options are what we ve always ordered to date and they ve been excellent. If you re looking for fast food Chinese, this is the place. 

Dim Sum has always been perfectly flavoured and steamed, it arrives fresh and still hot (I burned my tongue and learned that the hard way). Don t know if they make this onsite or if it s pre-frozen and steamed onsite, but it works. $35 for a tray to share with 2-3 people is pretty good for the area- I know you can get cheaper and better in Markham and Mississauga, but if it s 8pm on a Thursday night, I m ordering in. 

Chinese food, whether it s General Tso s chicken or a tofu based main or Singapore noodles, flavours are always well balanced without being overly sweet or overly spicy. Fried rice is always a go-to and never fails to disappoint.

718,"Unfortunately they did not let us make reservations probably because of the small size of the restaurant. 

I had a really uncomfortable time at this restaurant... let me tell you why...

The seating arrangement of the tables was very poor. 

We were seated on the second floor at a small table. There was another table, located one foot away from us, between us and the wall/window. Directly behind my friends seat was another table, so when she sat down, her chair was almost touching this other table. Directly behind my chair was someone else s chair. We were squished!!

When I sat down my chair was back to back with their chair. There was no room for the people in the table at the window to get out and for the servers to get over to them, so my friend and I had to stand up and tuck our chair in to let them through. When another couple came and sat there, I also had to stand up again and push my chair in to let them through. This was incredibly uncomfortable. 

A restaurant is supposed to be a relaxing place, especially when you are spending hard working money. I shouldn t be standing up and needing to let people through time and time again.

When serving the table behind me, the server had to squeeze behind my chair and stand right against the back and the side of my chair. It was not a relaxing dining experience at all! Service was okay at best, when they weren t getting me to stand up or squish us.

All the portions were big, and for the prices the food is amazing. It s definitely a great place if you want to eat great food for a fair price.

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
BETTER OPTIONS ELSEWHERE
- was served 3 risottos when I asked for one, and was blamed by the staff that I ordered that many
- risotto was raw as well

I was quite excited to try this place with two friends. The miscommunication ruined the whole experience for me. 

Knowing that the lunch stops at 3pm and that the risotto takes 40 mins to cook. I called in ahead of time to speak to someone around 1:30pm to have my amalfi risotto ready as I was making my way there. I spoke to a server, I informed her that I wanted 1 order of the Seafood risotto for a table of 3 people. I think it was this point where the miscommunication happened. She agreed and said it will be ready for us.

We arrived at 2pm, we spoke to the initial server and I asked him about the risotto, that I called in about. And he s like is it for here or to go? I told him that we were dining in. 

We were seated and waited for 40 mins. Before the risotto came out. To our surprise they brought us THREE RISOTTO dishes. Mind you, on the menu the risotto dish serves 2 people. At no point in time between 2pm to 2:40pm there was any clarification on the order. So I asked the server and informed him that I only wanted 1. So he fetched the server that I spoke to on the phone. And she insisted that I ordered 3 Risottos. I tried to explain to her that party was not ready to eat 6 peoples portion of risotto.

My experience is already ruined at this point. I don t know why she would think that I would want 6 people amounts of risotto. I could ve tried other things in the restaurant. 

The risotto itself looked amazing. So if the food was okay I didn t mind.

Unfortunately the risotto was under-cooked. It had a grainy, sandy texture that stuck to the teeth. I informed my guests, and another one agreed with me. I let the server know, he brought Chef Massimo Renzi tableside and he just told me it was cooked al dente, and that he used carnaroli rice. 

So know we re stuck eating extra risotto that was under-cooked. My other friend thought the rice was fine, until he tried the one underneath the top layer. I m assuming that the chef probably tasted that top layer and thought the other rice cooked as well. 

The seafood in the risotto was perfectly cooked but the dish was spoiled under-cooked rice. 

I think ultimately the experience was ruined when I got 3 Risottos instead of 1. Which caused the quality of control to go down on the rice. 

You will see in the photos that you can see the centre of the rice. Which is an indicator that the rice was raw.",0.0

We also ordered a bottle of red wine to share, needles to say they only have Italian wines in their selection.

786,"I ve always found Terroni (and some other similar Italian restaurants) slightly overpriced for the food, but I quite enjoyed my dinner here recently. My bill was almost $40 for a main and two apps split among 5 people, but I left quite satisfied and full.

We started off with the beef carpaccio and grilled calamari for the table. I wasn t the biggest fan of the carpaccio, which was thinly sliced raw beef served with spicy arugula and shaved cheese, drizzled with lemon juice. The contrast of the smooth beef, rich cheese, and harsh bite of the arugula was an interesting combination. I did, however, love the grilled calamari! The portion size was mediocre; there were only about three small pieces there. That said, it was grilled to a nice crisp and char, and was so flavourful! I enjoyed that it was also served on a leafy bed of greens with tomatoes, making it a nice and light starter.

My main was the Spaghetti in Canna al Mare - a tomato based spaghetti topped with different seafood such as clams, mussels, calamari, and shrimp. I was very pleasantly surprised at how generous they were with the toppings. My plate had lots of calamari and roughly 8 mussels/clams, along with two meaty shrimps. I wouldn t say that the seafood is very fresh, but the slightly spicy and tangy tomato sauce helped add some flavour and depth. The portions are actually a decent size too - I was unable to finish mine, but fortunately a friend pitched in and helped!

My friend ordered a pizza, and although I forget which one he got, I distinctly remember him asking the server for the one with the most meat (guys will forever be guys). I sampled a small bite, and it was pretty good! There s a fair amount of cheesy goodness on top, and the crust is super thin. There s a nice crunch when you bite into it. Our main complaint is that the pizza arrives uncut - and you re expected to use your fork and knife to manage.

On that note, keep in mind that Terroni doesn t really allow for substitutions or modifications (e.g., doesn t accommodate no cheese or sub cheese requests), and that extends towards asking for their pizza cut. Although my experience here was quite lovely, though I believe there are plenty other Italian places in the city to visit and will be unlikely to return anytime soon!",2.0
1595,"My review for Fishman is long overdue. It s been 3 months, and the food is still all I talk about. 

Located on the outskirts of Toronto, we arrived just an hour or so before closing. It s a restaurant decorated with grandeur. We had our hearts set on the fried crab legs with garlic (aka the renowned Jenga tower). Everything on the menu looked delightful so we decided on The King Crab and Lobster Dinner. This is a meal for 4, mind you. And we re a party of 2. We were warned by the young wait staff that it s too much food. Lol, once you break the price down to per serving, it s definitely a steal! Our waiter then confirmed with us that it s 6 lbs crab and 5 lbs of lobster! They brought out the live shellfish for us to take photos (for the Gram) and also to confirm the actual weights. 

The king crab went into the steamed crab meat with salted eggs, fried rice, and the oh-so-photogenic fried crab legs with fried garlic (Jenga tower). Both lobsters were used to make the HK-style lobster and fried rice. Included with our gorge fest was the daily soup and poached snow peas with goji berries.

We threw on the bib, pulled on the gloves, and went to work. Let me tell you...I would request this meal as my last on this Earth. The crab legs were so full of flavor. You see garlic pieces embedded into the shell. There s also a complex melody of spices. I found myself nibbling on the shells for the finely-coated batter. The lobster was just as delicious, with similarly garlicky flavors and spices. I would say the crab legs edged out the lobster as my favorite since the meat was so succulent. The crab (knuckles?) in egg was just okay. It was probably my least favorite. The greens helped everything go down better. (At my age, I can t handle as much meat as I used to.) A couple of the waiters stood by because they offered great service, marveled at how much we ve ordered and finished. My tummy has never been this satisfied. There s more where that came from!

You can only imagine how much leftovers we had. Our incredible waiter packed the lobster and the crab into catering trays and takeout containers. Luckily we were staying at an Airbnb, so we had access to an oven to gently reheat the trays of yumminess. It turned into 2 more meals lol. That s 6 servings of an all seafood meal for $388. I d say that was an excellent deal for an all seafood dinner. You can feast like us even if it s been you and a buddy. Oh, and don t forget to bring cash. They took our USD no problem. They don t accept cards! 

I ll always have fond memories of Fishman as the best meal I ve ever had. Plus, excellent service. Despite being the last patrons, we were never rushed but we made an effort to leave as soon as we finished.

1349,"Hits and misses at one of the most popular Thai spots in the GTA. It s legacy will be for ushering in an era of outstanding and competitive Thai cuisine to Toronto... But as it currently stands, it s good but not worth the long waits.

What We Got: Pad Kee Mao (chicken), Chef Top s Massaman Curry (Tofu), Green Curry (chicken), Thai Iced Tea

What We Liked: 
+curry was smooth and solid kick
+Pad Kee Mao was a big standout - definitely one of my favourite dishes ($17)
+Chicken didn t cost extra but beef did 

What We Didn t: 
-Thai Iced Tea was smooth but missing a ""tea"" flavour, especially as the ice slowly melted. 
-Chef s curry is quite sweet - would recommend only to those who want to mix a sweet tooth with an entree. Also very heavy with plenty of potatoes
-very noisy! Hard to have conversation and hear yourself
-spice levels seemed a bit off. I swear the Pad Kee Mao at level 3 seemed to be more mild than the curry at Level 2. Felt like it was the other way around!


What We Recommend
/Pad Kee Mao! Probably will try level 4 spicy next time, but I might stick with 3 just to doubly confirm next time

Next Time...
Will probably try Pad Thai, Khao Soi and some appetizers. But let s be grateful for all these outstanding Thai options nowadays.

Seating is a bit tight, so not the best winter spot with jackets, but there are some little storage spots found all around. Their decor, on the other had, is on point--and so is their food! I think pretty much anything here is a winner in my book. 

We got the wok cumin che mian, yopo biang biang mian, pork jia mo, spicy stewed beef noodle, and liang pi.
The wok cumin che mian is a nice spiced and savory side dish. It could realistically be considered a small meal if you ate it by itself. 
The yopo biang biang mian has a bit of everything. It has a sweet and savory taste and plenty of toppings for the noodles! I love how they really don t skimp out on the toppings, which likely consists of half the dish! Their noodles are also wonderfully springy. 
The pork jia mo was absolutely stuffed with filing and was delicious! Really great simple item if you re on the go. 
The spicy stewed beef noodle was very nice. The beef fell apart and the broth was savory. It s not a very stand-out dish at this place, as it closely resembles a lot of Chinese beef noodle soup offerings at restaurants--but it s tasty nonetheless. 
Their liang pi is very peanuty and not very spicy, despite what it looks like (at least in my opinion). It reminds me of Thai or Vietnamese style foods and is very refreshing! 

This is an absolutely amazing restaurant for super delicious noodle dishes and at a pretty fair price points, considering the location and quality! They have quite a variety of noodle dishes, so there s something for everyone. Would highly recommend coming here at least once!",2.0

We ordered many tastes from the menu. We started with several veggie dishes including the grilled asparagus, green salad and grilled runner beans. The favourite from the veggie dishes were the runner beans. They have a similar bite to cactus without the slimey texture. The addition of coconut and cotija cheese added unique flavours and textures to the earthy veggies. The restaurant makes its own masa based dishes and we opted for the Mamelas and the empanada. Both dishes were gluten free and delicious. The mamelas were a flavour bomb with trumpet mushrooms and a cheese sauce. For meat, we had the chorizo, steak and sweet breads. To be honest, the steak was a bit chewy and not a favourite of the group. The sweet breads however, were unreal. I have never had sweet breads before and the way that they were prepared at quetzal proved just how delicious a organ meat can be. For dessert we had the avocado ice cream with GRASSHOPPERS and a passion fruit mousse. I never thought I would enjoy grasshoppers but they truly added the most unique texture in contrast to the smooth creamy ice cream. All in all, quetzal puts an elegant spin on true traditional Mexican fare...this place is worth a visit and the hefty bill.",2.0
1280,"Amazing food and amazing experience. Our server was very helpful. We thought the portion sizes were going to be small so we were going to order too much but he helped us out a lot.

We started with the manti dumplings and the truffle pidhe which were both amazing. I m still drooling at the thought of the mushrooms. Definitely a must try! Then we got the brussel sprouts and the lamb for two. Both were amazing. The sprouts came with halloumi cheese. The lamb came on a tray with toppings to build your own wraps. It was so much food we got some to go 

We also got the tea service and ordered mint tea. It came with Turkish delight as appertiffs. It was amazing! The more we drank it the hungrier we got.

We were too full for a dessert so we just got saffron ice cream and Turkish coffee. Both were amazing. Such a great meal.",2.0
1545,"Don t let the low price fool you, those 3$ dumplings are worth at least 6$! Juicy made the perfect end to an evening, after having a few drinks at a bar nearby. Came her by recommendation from a local friend, and I m glad we did! 

Arrived around 11:30 pm and the place was packed! Lots of people getting takeout but also groups just hanging out. We had to see what the 3$ dumplings were all about, and to our surprise, they were really good! They are indeed juicy. The texture of the bun is thin and chewy, and right when you bite in you re hit with the hot pork broth that is really flavorful! Perfectly bite size as well, so it makes it super easy to pop the whole thing in your mouth.

1333,"Covid era ritual pick up order. I would recommend ordering ahead through the phone or app bc often times there is a line out the door and the last thing u want to do is wait to order and also wait to pick up. The line can get long to pick up the order bc u r waiting in the same line as food delivery workers and it becomes quite unpleasant when the weather gets too cold and windy or rainy. I noticed there is a price difference between lunch and dinner orders of the same thing. 

Pad see ew is what i only ever get a Thai restaurants. It s probably a solid B, better than most places but not the best I ever had due to it somewhat lacking in taste. 

I added a combo thing to my order which comes with a fresh spring roll which was good and a Tom yam? soup which I tried for the first time and can t say it s for me bc it s spicy and sour. 

Overall, the prices here seem to be on the higher side of Thai restaurants in the area. I would order again on ritual for lunch only.",2.0
1662,"A solid 4 stars.

General Tao Chicken ($14) and the Green Beans ($11) stole the show. Legit, these might be the best green beans I ve ever had and the portion is a good size for those concerned about $11 vegetables. 

The Green Onion Pancake ($6) was pretty tasty, and the Basil Fried Chicken was pretty good as well although a little dry. 
Admittedly the fried pork dumplings ($9) were a little too soggy, but when I brought the leftovers home and gave them an extra bit of pan frying for crispier edges was quite good.

411,"Tried to go here for our anniversary. No one acknowledged us at the door for quite a while. When the gentleman finally asked for how many and we answered three, he told us 5 min. There were several open tables, not sure why we had to wait, especially since I m visibly disabled. 

There was one table for two available at the front, and we watched him futz with it and add a third placemat to an already crowded table. When he motioned us over (he didn t come get us, just beckoned) I had to try to explain to him that this table was not suitable as my leg wouldn t fit. He said it was for three. I asked if we could have a four top. He said none were available. I tried again to explain that I m handicapped and wouldn t fit at this tiny table. 

Let me be clear, there were other available tables, but they were 6 tops, and he didn t want to lose the seats. I offered to wait for a four top but he said he couldn t tell me how long that would be. 

So we left. So much for hospitality. He was rude and dismissive and I won t waste the drive again. We went next door to the seafood restaurant. It was fabulous.",0.0

941,"""Hearty Italian"" are the two words that spring to mind when I think of 7 Numbers. The servings are generous, the food flavorsome and the presentation simple yet refined. My party of 4 tried the family sharing option whereby you each get to choose your own main dish but are also served with salads and calamari to start, then pasta before being laden with the mains plus sides, by which point you will be hard pressed to finish all the food on account of being so full up. 

The salads were an impressive start to the meal in that being so seemingly simple they still manage to be unique and tasty in their own way (we had spinach with mushroom sprinkled with soft cheese, rocket with red pepper sprinkled with soft cheese, and tomato with mozzarella in a vinagarette dressing). The calamari was also tender and enough for 2 pieces each. Of the pasta dishes the lasagne was by far the stand-out being wonderfully layered, enriched in a delicious tomato sauce and achieving an almost melt-in-the-mouth texture. Unfortunately the smaller pasta shells and brocollini I thought were a bit on the tough side. 

Then with the mains the cauliflower mash is a sizeable portion propping up its two lamb chops, the lamb shank is a mighty sight, and the hunter chicken came as two chunks of chicken surrounded by gravy and various vegetable pieces. Sadly one piece of the chicken was too salty to enjoy. The grilled zucchini was a delightful side to have alongside the meats whilst the accompanying salad I felt had been doused in too much vinegar. 

For a dessert, the nutella tiramisu fills a surprisingly big container - similar to the size of a small plate and certainly something a single person might find a challenge to finish eating, especially after the unsurmountable amounts of food we d already had, nevertheless if you are up to the task, this dessert is indeed well made and worth a try.

All in all 7 numbers may be a little rough-around-the-edges and go a bit overboard with some of its flavoring but it can offer a wholesome good-value meal, perfect for a cosy night out with friends or loved ones.",2.0
149,"I ve never eaten street tacos in Mexico, but El Trompo markets itself as offering exactly those and I imagine that they re not wrong in doing so. These are ""street"" in the way ""street"" should connote - quick and simple. They won t blow you away. In fact, the might not even impress you much. But if you re looking for tacos at a reasonable price, these will do the trick. I got the Al Pastor. I m not a big pork guy, but that s what the menu recommends so I thought I d give em a try. Not bad! None of the porky taste I generally shy away from, and the pineapple is a nice touch. I was worried they d be dry based on looking at them, but the pineapple substituted nicely for what could ve (should ve?) been fat. I asked for a shot of their cheapest tequila, which apparently was $7. So not cheap exactly.

The truth is this place is underwhelming. There used to be a terrific place for tacos just down the street in a sort of makeshift food court, but it s since shut down. I give El Trompo 4 stars mostly because it s been there a while and I worry what might come after it. Kensington Market is a gem, and I ll be damned if it changes even more than it already has.",2.0
1451,"Revisiting Hong Kong Bistro Cafe after their renovation, it was like a totally new experience. The place looks much more modern and inviting. As always, super friendly service and solid food. 

I got the grilled chicken steak with black pepper sauce on rice - it was absolutely delicious and it s become my favourite dish there! There was plenty of sauce covering the chicken, which was perfectly cooked as it was tender yet had nice crispy edges. For $11, you get a giant portion and I could only finish about half of it. 

The baked pork chop on rice with tomato sauce comes in a large dish but it does take some time to cook. It was very good - the crispy pork chop pieces were tasty and they certain don t skimp on the meat portion compared to the rice. 

Lastly, I never pass up the opportunity to get their HK-style milk tea. It s a nice balance of the slight bitterness of the tea and creaminess of the milk.

I recently dined at Playa Cabana and was wow d. This place really needs 5 stars because the food was AMAZING, but it gets 4 stars because the service was pretty bad. 

It wasn t busy at all when I walked in, maybe 2 tables were full. I kinda already knew what I wanted (who else checks the menu before hand) lol. 

Ordered the short rib tacos because holy hell it sounded amazing, short rib enchiladas (yes, I love short rib) grilled Mexican corn, the tres leche cake & Churros. Relax, relax, I wasn t alone. The tacos were delicious, please please don t change the menu! I have to say the Enchiladas were my favourite. The beans had so much flavour, the sauces were perfect & the combination of all the flavours with the extra sauces on the table made my life complete! The grilled corn was okay, but nothing special. 

Moving on to the highlight - Dessert! Wow! The Churros were actually fucking amazing. So crunchy, so much sugar. The cake was nothing like I ve tasted, so moist and light. I could have eaten 3 slices!

852,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca. (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)

Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed? That was our experience.

Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped. If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.

Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!

Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa. 

So if you are even a little claustrophobic, be warned, you won t be comfortable here. 

The food:

Complimentary bruschetta: A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn t that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.

Caesar salad: Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.

Bread basket: Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread. 

Spaghetti Carbonara: The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca s version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper. 

Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta: I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.

Tiramisu: No coffee flavour! I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting. Libretto s Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca s lacked. My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.

Lemon Sorbet: Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy. I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste. I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours. Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.

Ladies, please don t drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant! Ugh!

TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing. Not worth a second visit.

Food wise I would say was ok, like 3.5/5 stars. This is because the portions seemed very small. The calamari appetizer tasted good, mushroom salad appetizer was good but not worth the price in my opinion, the complimentary bread was a bit burnt and too crunchy, the mozarella with tomato wasn t worth the price and was too simple ... For the main course I got the chicken (first item on the menu under secondi). It came with two large pieces of white and dark meat with potatoes, a grilled lemon on top, and some veggies. This was worth the price because of the amount of meat that was given. A few people at my table ordered the gnocchi which looked very plain when it arrived, but tasted ok. The gnocchi is the same price as the chicken and I would say the chicken is worth more.

1548,"Location/Service
This place is near Spadina, a slight off West of Chinatown. You can t miss the place cause there are big arrows and a large entrance sign noting where it is. 

Inside is relatively big, where there s good seating available and also a good assembly line to order and take out. 

Staff can speak Mandarin, okay nice, and very fast with orders (especially having a pager system). 

Food
Came here for a quick snack, which one of their top item is the $2.99 six piece dumpling. For that price, even if it s a little bland, it s justifiable. But to my surprise, the dumplings were in fact juicy! You can see clearly that the skin was thin, and when you taste it, it s packed with a good amount of meat and juice. They re not huge, but good enough to enjoy as a bite size. They also provide soy sauce to make it more flavourful if required. 

Definitely took me by surprise at this place. Although I didn t get the opportunity to try other items, but worth coming back to eat the dumplings (in fact, getting a dozen for the price range)!",2.0
734,"It s become increasingly clear that ambiance plays almost as big a role in my enjoyment of a meal as the food itself, and this concept was certainly illustrated in spades during my time at Enoteca Sociale.

We arrived around 6:00 on a weekday, and though we didn t have a reservation, we were immediately shown to a table on the patio.

It s a nice patio, admittedly, but there are definitely some problems. The biggest and most obvious issue is the lack of space between the tables. We were sitting between two other tables and there was probably only a few inches separating us and our neighbors. It was less than private, to put it mildly.

We were also sitting underneath some trees and there was some sap or something that kept falling. The diners to our left actually wound up moving because of it, and my dining companion wound up with some gross-looking stuff on her shirt.

It s not exactly an atmosphere conducive to enjoying a quiet, romantic meal, is my point.

Anyway, in terms of the food, Enoteca Sociale is definitely an above-average destination. We were presented with some complimentary bread to snack on, and it was delicious. The bread was fresh and tasty, while the accompanying oil contained a smokiness that I found irresistible.

For my main, I went with the Amatriciana (""Guanciale, tomato, Pecorino Romano & chili""), and aside from the fact that it s an almost comically small portion (I think I ate the whole thing in about two minutes), this is definitely a top-notch bowl of pasta. The tomato sauce contains exactly the sort of deep richness that one covets, while the pasta itself was cooked quite well. The concoction could ve been hotter (i.e. it was probably sitting for a few minutes before I got it), but otherwise I really dug the heck out of this.

Arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $12
- This was the best dish of the evening (sad isn t it? It was just a salad). I liked it as the goat cheese was part of the dressing. The red pepper was delish but wish the portion was bigger. A tad small for $12

Veal Lasagne - Lasagne with fresh-made pasta sheets, fresh ground veal, mozzarella, and housemade sauce $12.75 (large)
- Our friends ordered a small variation of this and honestly perhaps we should have ordered the small as well. It looked around the same size except it was on a slightly larger plate. There was too much pasta and sauce and too little meat. My friend called her small bowl a snack size pasta. Very saucy. That ""homemade"" sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes... But it wasn t that impressive. Tasted like something from a can. 

Meatballs - Big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, smothered in sauce $13
- I didn t like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it. There was only a small pinky tip size mozzarella bit in it. Wasn t even served hot. Way too much sauce. I ended up dipping bread with it.

As for service, the server who served us was very polite but the general manager Tom? (glasses with plaid shirt) was super rude. Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if I had known, I would have removed this table long ago (they attached another small table to one end). I think he could have handled the situation a lot better. Thanks for denting the mood of a friend s birthday. We noticed Tom kept giving our table dirty looks as well.

1426,"[4.5/5 STARS] TLDR: HUGE FAN! My boyfriend brought me here for our one year anniversary dinner. Fave thing I ate here was the deep fried octopus tacos. The jicama shell was the most interesting take on a taco shell I ve ever had. 

We started off with some house cocktails. I one that tasted like gin and he got the one with scotch. They were okay. 

The food on the other hand. Delicious! We couldn t decide which dishes to try, the waitresses and waiters were really helpful they suggested the tasting menu which is $68/person and made up of 5 courses of the Dailo s ""greatest hits"" - popular items on and off the menu. Probably the best decision we made. We made sure they knew my dietary restrictions and we were good to go!

They started us off with two amuse-bouche s which was a like a yam dressed in sake. So good! Next course was the Crispy Octopus Tacos (my fave!!!) and Pomelo Betel Leaf. I love the freshness of the lemon grass and the contrast with textures from the nut crumble. Third course was an carnita empanada with satay sauce (not on their current menu) and this tofu tomato salad that tasted like a play on a dairy-free (no mozzarella) caprese salad. The dough for the empanada was sweeter than i was used to but the sauce was so savoury! It made the dish for me! The tofu in the salad was prepared in a way to almost taste like the texture of cheese. It was very interesting and tasty as well. Fourth course we were served their Ontario Pea Dumplings (with truffles) - so rich so heavy so savoury very yummy - and their Hakka Brown Wontons. The sauce with the almond crumble on the wontons was to die for! The wontons themselves tasted so homey. I loved it. Lastly our fifth course was the lamb and sticky rice dish that came with a slaw (so good!!!) and the beet coconut curry dish. By the time I was done with the huge piece of lamb I didn t even have enough room to really enjoy the beet coconut curry. I liked them both though. They finished us off with a ginger sorbet palette cleanser. It was a lot of food for $68/person. I think if you have an appetite this is a great value for the quality of food you get. 

The only criticism I had was that at the end of the meal everything was starting to taste like betel leaf - that minty peppery taste - they had used it chopped up in most of the dishes they served us. The dishes on it s own with the betel leaf were delicious if we ordered that solely, but as a tasting menu, it was sort of overplayed all together.",2.0

PEI oysters: Great to start with - accompanied with hot sauce (not seafood sauce), black vinegar, and fresh horseradish. Fresh and high quality

Steaks: Very glad that our waiter was open to serving a Chicago style blue rare steak, which was finely executed (minus whoever cut open the steak to check how well it was cooked). The 45 day dry aged striploin was marvellous, perfectly and evenly cooked as expected. The waiter explained all steaks in good detail and helped us make a decision. 

To finish: Without reminding them that we were celebrating a birthday, they decorated our dessert with was very thoughtful! Delicious muffins are given to take home, and small chocolates to end the meal. 

The negative: Personally I did not like our waiter who seemed very ""pushy"". He would recommend drinks and desserts before we asked for recommendations, and made it very awkward to choose otherwise. Also he rarely made visits to our table, taking away from the experience.

276,"Very fun place to have some amazing tacos! I went there with my friends (a group of 6). We made a reservation just in case, I thought we wouldn t need one because it was a Wednesday night, however, the place was so full! That made me so excited! They gave us a nice big table for us. I ordered 3 tocos, La Carnita, Baja Shrimp, In Cod We Trust. All of them are very nice! I am not an expert on Mexican food, but I would like to say that their tacos were on point! Their sauces were cohesive with the components in each taco, offering you some enjoyable bites. I also had their Pilsner beer, which was very interesting and went well with tacos. I thought the price was fair too. The server was very friendly and funny as well. Maybe it would ve been better if the music was not too loud because it was a Wednesday night. If that was a Friday night, the loud music would be better. Overall, the food and service were very nice, I was very satisfied!",2.0
1881,The service was really courteous and attentive. The food was really original and tasty with a really authentic feel. A nice calm atmosphere if you are looking to get away from the crowds. Dim sum is top notch and is made in such inventive ways! Desserts are inventive and light--yummy!,2.0
553,"Didn t expect much going into the restaurant but was quite surprised by how roomy it is inside. They can easily host parties with reservations.

We ordered a burrito and one of the make-your-own tacos. Everything was nicely seasoned and they had free chips to start. They also offered 3 types of dips ranging from mild to spicy. Great service with big portions of food. Would come back again",2.0
675,"Absolutely another one of those hidden gems! I very much recommend going if you re looking for delicious yet affordable cheap eats!

I had the prosciutto bruschetta toast. Unlike the bruschetta with the diced tomato, this is more of your open sandwich idea. The bread was garlic bread! Super pleasing. The prosciutto was plentiful and the arugula was a great match.

We sat in and it took little time to get our food. The server was genuinely so nice and attentive. 

I really recommend stopping by and enjoy a no frills eating environment.",2.0
1681,"As an avid fan of Dagu, I must say that Fudao is a veryyy close second (I ll explain why later). Their prices are on average $2 ish cheaper than Dagu and the concept is similar with a few differences in the toppings. I got their picked cabbage soup and man was it good. The soup came out bowling hot and it was hard to not want to drink it in a rush because the flavor was ON POINT. The reason why rated this second to Dagu is because the rice noodles are thinner and I prefer thicker noodles. All in all, 5/5 for value and variety.",2.0

1812,"I was always a bit skeptical when it came to chain Chinese restaurants, but Asian Legend proved me wrong. Unlike many other North American Chinese restaurants that serve greasy, oily, and overly salty food, Asian Legend s dishes are lighter, less oily, and yet they still pack in flavours. The ambience inside is clean, nice, and I like how they give you paper to write down your orders yourself (like in some dim sum places). Portion sizes are just right, and customer service is quite good.

Asian Legend specializes in northern-style Chinese cuisine, with all-day dim sum that includes xiao long bao and other steamed dumplings. The dim sum menu isn t as large as those in other dim sum places, but their dishes are of high quality. Review of some of the items that I ve tried:

- Steamed Vegetarian Dumplings: Come in 6 large pieces in a bamboo basket; filled with minced greens and mushrooms - very flavourful.

- Assorted Seafood with Sizzling (Crispy) Rice: They ask if you want the seafood & vegs with sauce to be poured over the crispy rice or not (some people prefer the crispy rice to stay crispy). Delicious dish - the assorted seafood includes shrimps, scallops, calamari, with assorted vegetables (broccoli, carrot, snap peas, shiitake mushrooms).

- Snow Pea Shoots with Garlic: Standard but awesome accompaniment to the other dishes.

- Fried Rice with Diced Fish, Ginger, and Egg White: This caught me by surprise (in a good way) because it s not as oily or greasy as the fried rice in many other Chinese restaurants. It s light, tastes ""healthy"", with a good amount of diced fish, egg whites, small ginger slices, and some vegs.",2.0
1558,"Special Lanzhou Noodles with Beef // GB Hand Pulled Noodles.
--
This place is really small, so there was a decent line around noon. It s best not to come here with more than 3 people. At the front of the store, you can see the noodles being made as orders come in (I.e. you can see someone physically making the noodles). Pictured here are my friends extra wide noodles. I got the thick noodles (circular with a big diameter). I would recommend the extra wide noodles tbh, because the extra thick ones had a doughy taste when I chewed it since the soup wasn t able to penetrate into the noodle. The extra wide noodles have more surface area exposed to the broth, so each bite would be more flavourful! Also, they have extra chili oil on the side if you want to make it spicier! I actually found it to be at a good level of spice. Overall a decent portion, and they didn t cheap out on the beef.",2.0
1055,"Recently came here with my friends on a saturday night. There s parking along the street and we were lucky to snag a spot close to the restaurant. The restaurant is bigger than it looks on storefront - there s actually two floors! When we first walked in it was kind of awkards becuase i had to check in with the hostess but there s only standing room behind the door and we felt kind of awkward standing there while they figure out which table we were in. They were very accomodating tho - we ran late for about 15 mins past reservation and they saved the table for us.

Our table was actually down the stairs - there was a function that night so it was a bit loud on the main floor, but downstairs it s actually much nicer and quiet. Spacing is a bit tight, but we manage to fit in a baby okay! But i would not recommend bringing in a stroller coz there s no room for that. 

Servers and staff were all very nice and friendly. lots of options to choose from - i ordered the special that night which was braised wild boar with polenta and veg. I dont like polenta, so i asked server if i could substitute with pasta and they were able to do that with no extra charge - i asked for the fresh tegliatelle with tomato sauce. My hubby had their bufala pizza, and my other friends ordered the tegliatelle with funghi, tegliatelle with ragu and another order of the wild boar. 

Food was great! we ordered an app to share but in hindsight was not the best choice - ordered the speck and bufala and the portion was kind of small that it was a bit tough to share amongst 5 ppl. but it was very tasty.

Then the mains - they were great on the whole! the pizza was nice and crispy, lots of toppings - the middle was a bit dense tho so the pizza couldn t hold up as well as i would have liked. The wild boar was very delicious and tasty, but i felt the meat was a bit dry, almost tough in certain chunks. They gave me the polenta anyway for presentation purposes (which i gladly took pics of lol) and they served the pasta on the side instead. In general, portions were good. I felt the special the portion was a bit small for it s price point - I woud ve been more full with their pasta/pizza options. HOwever, since i did have pasta on the side, I really really liked it. There is a difference in the fresh pasta compared to the dry and my friends really liked the funghi (very tasty mushrooms) and the ragu the meat was soft and moist. 

For dessert we ordered the dessert platter for four - which included the panna cotta, tiramisu, chocolate fondant cake and cheesecake. 

All four were great - loved sharing it and getting a bit of each. my handsdown favourite was panna cotta. I normally don t like panna cotta, but theirs is so creamy and rich, not too jelly like and the texture and taste BLEW my mind! Tiramisu was good too but wasn t able to outshine the panna cotta. The chocolate cake was delicious and rich. Cheesecake was average (taste just like typical cheesecake so nothing particularly special). 

All in all it was a great meal - we stayed for almost 3 hours and they didn t rush us! we were really thankful for that esp since it is a busy night for them. I will definitely be back again soon!",2.0

First, banh mi shouldn t take forever to make. Go to any Vietnamese place and the person behind the counter will literally slap together a sandwich in a matter of minutes. They have a team of people working here and it still takes longer somehow.

Second, the banh mi itself (i.e., the bread) doesn t taste right. It s not crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. As for the rest of the sandwich, there s something about it that lacks authenticity. Atop of this, it s way pricier than it should be.",0.0

It s quite a hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant. It s very crowded all the time and feels sort of steamy inside during the summer hours--but what would you expect with steaming baskets and so many people?

The steamed dumplings are wonderfully juicy while the pan fried dumplings are crunchy--albeit a bit dry.

The tacos are massive! I thought 2 wouldn t be enough but it was more than enough. They also have many different hot sauces you can add. Never have I eaten tacos with a fork but trust me, these are very big and I had to eat half the inside before I was able to somewhat grab them.

Our server was quick to grab us some menus and take drink orders. They have a decent sized menu and the pasta was noted as something to get in reviews, so I went with that recommendation. Per usual, fellow Yelpers didn t let me down. They were happy to do spaghetti noodle with their bolognase sauce, despite it not technically being a menu option.

Ok moving onto the food. The food was SO GOOD! I m definitely a meat lover over a veggie lover , but the vegetable appetizer I ordered was delicious. It had a deep, smoky flavor and was seasoned well. Same goes for the yaki udon. The mackerel sushi was lightly blow torched and didn t have a fishy taste. The desserts were also excellent. I HIGHLY recommend the black sesame ice cream for those that like that flavor. Tasted like straight up frozen black sesame seeds (in the best way possible).

It s been quite a while since I had some noodles in soup so I decided upon going to a place I ve known since childhood. Upon entering, I was seated immediately and I ordered a bowl of Beef Brisket Rice Noodle Soup. 

The broth was exactly how I remembered from my youth. Layers of flavour, while still retaining its heat. The rice noodles were cooked to a decent al dente, however the beef brisket was a bit disappointing. It was not tender and took quite a while for me to chew. I did wish they cooked down the brisket a lot more as any good beef noodle soup does require soft and tender beef brisket. 

The service is what you would expect at any quick service Chinese restaurant. You go there, order quickly, eat and get out. 

It s a great place for a quick bite from their wide extensive menu, especially if you re looking for a homestyle meal after the bar/club. This place has lot a bit of its mystique from its hey day but it is still one of Chinatown s prime spots for Cantonese food.",1.0
1594,"Another year has passed by and the HK-style ""Lobster Mountain"" is now back with a mix of fries & fried anchovies. This was a pleasant surprise as they did away with the anchovies/smelt fish citing rising costs several years ago. It caused a bit of a stir, but now the mix is the best of both worlds: east meets west fusion! Kids certainly don t mind the fries. So it s great when restaurants listen to customer feedback.

Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is still the place for the ultimate seafood experience at reasonable prices. With a reservation, we were seated shortly upon arrival. Made our order, and a big fresh 5.5 lb lobster was brought to our table for photos. The wok-tossed Lobster Mountain always impresses, not only based on presentation but also because each huge piece is crispy, slightly spicy, and still very succulent and tender. The other dishes also pair well: silkie chicken soup, snow peas, lobster roe fried rice and sea bass which were more than enough for our table of 3. This year dessert was even elevated with macarons; I usually find these treats overly sweet but here it was perfect. No wonder some people come to Toronto just to try this restaurant.

Occasionally, I hear complaints about their no-nonsense service. But they were very courteous despite the fast pace of service for Lunar New Year dinner. Our dishes arrived quickly, tea was replenished, full plates of shells were replaced. Even the leftovers were packed by a smiling waiter. Funniest thing was when another waiter with the bill offered to give us a toony for exact change. He even wished us well for the new year, just amazing service!",2.0

It s just so inconvenient to make these Xi an hand pulled noodles at home and hard to find a place in Toronto that delivers thick noodles in the right texture and comforting flavours. Tomato and egg and eggplant is not something you typically find with noodle dishes and just love the tomato/egg as it s a staple comfort food in Chinese cuisine. 

This place has it all in terms of what I look for in a good noodle joint, hand pulled, great flavors, GREAT value and complimentary ingredients. They don t skimp out the veggies or give bad cuts of meat like some places do. Love the pork belly. 

I tried the biang biang and beef rib soup noodle. I say the biang biang is a must try when you first come. Beef rib soup noodle is just not as good.

It was presented in the usual bamboo steamer and you get 10 small bite size pieces. It certainly wasn t my favourite because the skin was thick & some seemed under cooked. The pork filling was okay but the soup content wasn t very consistent. Some were not replete with soup when biting into them and overall wasn t very satisfying.

136,"Good Hombres serve elevated tacos that bring sentiments of great, authentic Mexican food. Prepared with care and attention, this delicious meal is perfectly true in every way. On the northwest side of Dundas and Bathurst (look for the TACOS TACOS TACOS window), there is a little mystic tortilla-making machine that sends fresh, perfectly perfect tortillas onto a conveyor belt - made on demand. 

When you enter the modern, casual, grab-and-go, airy taco joint, you re greeted by colours of blue and yellow, stainless steel, and bar seating that lines the spacious frontline kitchen where you see the magic happen. The taco menu is diverse but everything is delicious. $3.75 per taco. Order 4 if you re hungry, 2-3 for a snack. The only seating is by the kitchen where there are condiments of pickled vegetables and a delicious ""salsa macha"" from Veracruz which is prepared with oil, chili and garlic. It s absolutely divine when drizzled on the tacos.

Their staple tacos, illustrated on a hand-written chalkboard menu, are colourful, whimsical creations that tickle your palate in flavours that are true to the history of the Mexican tortilla, and are served on fun bright vibrant plates:

1. Pastor: PORK shoulder, salsa macha, pineapple

2. Carne Asada: STRIPLOIN, salsa verde (green sauce)

3. Pescado: HADDOCK, lettuce, chipotle

4. Pollo Asado: CHICKEN thighs, salsa macha

5. Tinga de Pollo: CHICKEN breast, tomato, chipotle

6. Rajas Poblanas: roast poblano PEPPERS (a mild chili pepper from Puebla, Mexico), cotija (a hard cow s milk cheese from Mexico)

7. Chiles Toreados: shishito PEPPERS (a sweet, East Asian variety), black beans, salsa roja (red sauce)

8. Costillitas de Res: BEEF short ribs, salsa roja

9. Lengua: TONGUE, salsa macha, salsa verde

We had the tacos with haddock, beef short ribs, chicken tinga and tongue, and they were all flavourful bursts of juicy deliciousness; light and carefully crafted that looked so much fun to eat. It tastes like lots of time, effort, and love were folded in as the main ingredients in this timeless, traditional Mexican dish. We wanted to try them all-and we most definitely will next time (and as much as our waistline allows!).

On the menu, there s also:
- Quesadillas: $6
- Drinks: $2-3
- Masa (dough made from corn flour; used to make tortillas): $10/kg
- Tortillas: $14/kg

As a downtown Toronto Yelper, Good Hombres is midway between Dundas and Ossington (hipster mecca) and Chinatown (dim-sum heaven) and across the street from Toronto Western Hospital. But more importantly, it s a new taqueria that is worth coming back time after time for authentic, juicy, flavourful tacos that are a joy to eat. -Tell them Will and Justin from Yelp sent you here and wear your stretchiest pants, your belly will thank you.

I arrived first; our table was at the back and ready. Not a large restaurant as it used to be a home. Classic features and comfortable chairs. So far, so good. 

The rest of our party arrived and our fabulous server was there to take our orders. Another server brought over a complimentary slice of bruschetta while we waited. Mmmmmm. He brought our drinks, a fresh bread basket and went over the specials. They sounded so good, I crumbled and ditched my original choice for the Stuffed Gnocchi with Mushrooms and Sundried Tomatoes in a Rose Sauce($22). My friends ordered Spaghetti Mare Di Mario(seafood in spaghetti for $25), Salisiccia E Quaglia Alla Griglia(4 types of meat for $28) and Bomba Pizza(cheese, green peppers, sausage, onions for $18). 

After the bruschetta and trying to abstain from eating a whole loaf of bread, the food arrived. Hot and smelling amazing. After we were all done taking photos of each other s food, the table fell silent as we dug in. After we all tasted our food, we proceeded to share it. SO good. Healthy portions allowed us to share it without any of us feeling guilty. Everyone agreed my Gnocchi was to die for. The pizza was perfect; thin crust and lots of toppings. The 4 meat dish was polished off. All meats were seasoned perfectly. The seafood pasta had a heap of pasta under those clams! 

We were all so full, dessert wasn t even an option. The wine list was delightful. They offered perfect wines to compliment any meal Fieramosca has to offer.

1868,"I highly recommend this restaurant if you want to try North-West Chinese eats that are different from usual westernized Chinese food (aka fried rice, General Tao, etc.)

My first impression was the interior - very bright and modern with transparent glass stools, unlike other typical Chinese restaurants that run on a warm and cozy vibe. Even though the restaurant looked spacious from outside, it was actually quite tight with limited seats. 

Since it was our first visit, we opted for the restaurant s bestsellers, which were beef Yopo BiangBiang (wide flat noodles) and Pork JiaMo (pork bun). The noodles arrived quickly after 5 minutes with tomato scrambled egg, braised beef, and assortments of vegetables (cubed potatoes, carrots, ear fungus, edamame, zucchini). At first, I thought the combination of ingredients was peculiar; however, it turned out to be absolutely delicious as different flavors really complimented each other. I also enjoyed their chewy ""ribbon noodles""! If you are not able to handle spicy food like I am, I d recommend asking the waitress for no (or less) chilli flakes since they really added some intense heat to the dish. The pork JiaMo was good as well - the shredded meat was well-marinated. 

We visited a few days after Grand Opening and the restaurant was quite packed. However, service was still quick and efficient.

1640,"Stopped by this place on a weeknight for a quick bowl of noodles and wasn t disappointed. The interior is simple and clean while service was average. This place specializes in braised meats (chicken, pork ribs, beef brisket) served over noodles or rice. Their braised chicken is comparable to Yang s braised chicken and was very tender. FYI their medium spice wasn t that spicy (and I m normally a mild spice kind of girl). The portion sizes are fair (get a large if you re a meat eater) but it could be quite expensive if you want to add on veggies or other toppings. I don t really recommend the pork ribs because it was pretty dry and flavorless. The noodles and broth were delicious and reminded me of what I usually get at Hey Noodles.",2.0
1799,"I am a huge fan of Xian style Biang Biang Mein. I haven t found a place in Toronto that makes this. Therefore, when I found a picture of this dish on their ad outside I had to try it. It is strange that I could not find a yelp review. However, there were plenty of google reviews on this restaurant.

It s own by a couple and I feel they gear their restaurant to Chinese speaking customers. Their English is quite weak. I ordered the Biang Biang noodles and steam dumplings. I wrote the number down and wrote the English name on the paper. The lady had to clarify what I meant with another customer. They make their dumplings from scratch and have a pretty big menu.

I do have to admit their Biang Biang noodles and their dumplings are not the best I had. However, they are cheaper than other places around Spadina. What I did not enjoy was one of the owner/cook was clearing his throat alot during the time I was there which was very gross because you hope he did not spit on your food. Really, clearing your throat should be done in the privacy of your own home and not your business where they are customers.

The owners are nice but they are more friendly to Chinese speaking customers because they can communicate with them. If you cannot speak Chinese they will serve you but you will be ignored most of the time.",1.0
906,"I reallyyyy wanted to like this place, I was truly excited to try it. 
The ambiance, the decor and the service were all great. But the food was just average for me. 

I really loved the caff con zabaglione (espresso with sweet italian custard ) It was honestly the highlight of our meal. The Italian Custard gave it a wonderful sweet taste, similarly to how coffee with bailey s would taste. 

Unfortunately they didn t have many Gluten Free options or Vegetarian options, but we managed. 

I ordered the strapazzate dish (pulled mixed farm eggs, burrata & black truffles ) While to some it might seem like a delicate egg dish, to me, it tasted quite bland and lacked flavour. There was essentially no seasoning in the egg. All you tasted was plain egg with burrata cheese. 

I might come back here for a pastry and a coffee, but not for a meal",1.0
1791,"This restaurant was formerly known as ""Sichuan Garden Restaurant"" and re-opened last year as ""Ten Miles B.B.Q"". After reading positive reviews about their Dan Dan Noodles and Sichuan cuisine I popped in alone for a quick lunch. I was greeted with a very confusing menu. I wanted to order a few sides, but was advised by the server that my selections were too small. She did not suggest any alternatives. All of the multiple small plates seem to have only one ingredient and no options for combination dishes like a mixed vegetable platter. I am happy to pay more for more content, but $12 for just bok choy? $6 for one small skewer of basic mushrooms? had to call her over twice until she finally helped me narrow it down to Dan Dan Noodles and a mushroom pot. I was hungry and desperate to order anything at this point. THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE THE FOOD ARRIVED. The Dan Dan Noodles were tasty, but after that the server and kitchen staff seemed to prioritize take out orders over mine. At about 45 mins + from when I walked I had to flag two servers to ask about the mushroom pot I had ordered. The kitchen staff had only just started the dish! At that point I paid for what I had eaten and walked out. If you want UNHELPFUL ,SLOW & UNATTENTIVE servers and kitchen staff that (prioritize Uber Eats orders over sit down guests) and don t own up to their mess ups than you might enjoy this restaurant. I myself will NEVER RETURN. There are thousands of restaurants in the GTA. DON T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this one! P.S. The management was non-existent. P.P.S.

Had the green curry with fish. For $16 you get a ton of food. Got about 5 pieces of delicious fish (Basa though, but I like the taste of Basa). The fish is not over battered in its panko crust. Fried to perfection and very juicy. The curry sauce is so good which is served on the side. I dipped the fish and poured some on my rice.

We were both stuffed by the end of it and walked all the way home to digest our meal. They by no means skim on the butter or cream and that s what made it so good. The sauce was absolutely delicious.

1914,"Tasty! It s impossible to walk by this store without first noticing the sweet smell of duck that drifts out of its doors. Drawn by the scent and my curiosity, I came here on a Monday evening not sure what to expect and I left pleasantly surprised.

The restaurant mainly focuses on duck and noodles and gets both of these things right! I ordered the 6 piece duck wings and a hot sesame dry noodle bowl. The duck wings are seasoned in a spicy, sweet dry rub that s flavored with Sichaun peppercorns which lead to a mild numbing flavor after you ve eaten it. The duck wings were moist and tender, almost falling off the bone although this was after they were heated up (the restaurant serves them cold). The sesame noodles were nutty and a little spicy (less than the duck) and worked well with the duck.

Other offerings on their menu include duck feet, neck, head, leg, tongue and other parts of the duck as well as a small bubble tea menu. Although I kept to the safer option with the wings, I m sure the other parts of the duck could be tasty as well, though definitely suited to the more adventurous! The interior has lots of seating and it looks like there are plans to have a backyard patio space. The service was fast and friendly! Definitely worth checking out if you re in the area.",2.0

I ate a piece before I could even snap a picture. We ordered the grilled calamari as an app. It was seasoned simply and well. You could taste the charred, grilled flavor. It was served with tomatoes, olives, etc. 5 stars for that alone. 

For entrees my friend got the daily special of halibut served with an avocado salsa she tasted tasted amazing. I got the rack of lamb cooked medium. The seasoning was perfection and the lamb was cooked perfectly. It came with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I cleaned my plate. Our server and the other servers helping him were hilarious.

They said it s one of the few places that had authentic Shantou noodles. So we tried the noodles with fish slices, fish balls, and beef brisket. The noodles instantly reminded me of the ones I had in Chiuchow and Shantou, which I still dream about. The broth was light, the noodles were cooked firm, and the fish balls were flavourful. The beef brisket was tender and juicy. Although these noodles can t exactly replicate my experience back in China, it did hit the mark! After finishing our noodle bowls, we also took out some fish balls to cook at home. It was such a satisfying and comforting meal. Looking forward to coming back for more noodles!",2.0
1300,"By far my favorite part about visiting a new city is seeking out (and often waiting in line for) their flagship ice cream shop. Surely Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery is Toronto s best, and it was worth every minute of my forty-five minute wait on a Friday evening. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Yes, the lines at Bang Bang can spiral seemingly out of control, but the neighborhood is conducive to it, there s signage, and above all else it s worth it. Even though they re surely swamped at all hours of the day, the servers are friendly and efficient. 

One of my favorite parts of Bang Bang was that, to keep things moving, they curb tasting during peak hours, which honestly makes a lot of sense. Think about it - when you go elsewhere, to say a restaurant, are you able to sample what you order beforehand? Of course not, and in this case it s a reasonable trade off to keep the line moving. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

$8.90 CAD got me a colossal ice cream sandwich packed with two full sized scoops. While I initially scoffed a bit at the price point, after a quick bit of math I realized that for well under $10.00 I was getting two scoops of specialty ice cream and two everything cookies, which was a bargain. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

I don t have enough superlatives in my vocabulary to describe how amazing this all was. For starters, the everything cookie is a new benchmark for amazing cookies, and I could have eaten a dozen of these and been perfectly content. From there, the Burnt Toffee and CinnaCrunch ice creams were absolutely out of this world, and competed easily with some of my favorites elsewhere around North America. Amazing. Two Stars. 

Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?

This was some of the best ice cream I ve ever had, and surely Bang Bang has perfected the dessert shop here in Toronto. Star.",2.0
1084,"Came here for a late lunch with my boyfriend. Love the ambience and the decor of this place. Unfortunately, this was the highlight of the entire meal. Service was very lack-lustre, perhaps we caught them at a time when they were recovering from the lunch rush. A bit disappointing considering there were only a couple of tables and you d think service would then be on point.

We shared the frutti di mare, some olives, and the chitarra carbonara, and a couple of glasses of wine. The frutti di mare was quite fresh, but the portion was quite small considering the price point. The olives were pretty delicious and was a great little appy. Unfortunately, the carbonara, which looked amazing was flavourless, dry, and lacked any seasoning. The egg itself was fantastic but barely provided any flavour or added any creaminess to the pasta.

I was a bit surprised to find this well run taco joint amongst all Korean restaurants but it really works!

Lots of bench style seating easily fits 4, but gets squishy as this place fills up at lunch time. The service is quick, the food came fast and hot and for tacos, quesadilla, burrito type foods, but our pupusa came after tacos, maybe cuz of table room? Cuz they certainly not a dessert dish. 

The warm corn wraps were so so good, guacamole was fresh and the perfect green and texture. I had to try one fish and one shrimp taco with a squash pupusa(pan fried puffy corn tortilla pancake like thing? served with a pickled cabbage slaw and hot sauce salsa) and was ok full but ordered another shrimp taco just in case 

Easily you can start lunch less than $4, but really takes 3-4 tacos for a good lunch which run closer to $15, they have good combos for certain days which is nice and take out was very popular while we were here.

544,"Almost gave it two stars (read to find out more) but the one thing I can t get over is serving an alcoholic drink to someone who specified ""virgin"", when you delivered it to the table she checked again that it was ""virgin"", you agree verbally it had no alcohol, she tries some, tastes alcohol and then you go -- ""Oooh actually this one is the virgin"". Sure, if she was pregnant or on medication or driving, maybe the sip of alcohol wouldn t be *that* big a deal. But if she was recovering alcoholic, that one sip could literally change her life, and it s up to you as a business to be honest and knowledgeable about what you re serving.

Things that were terrible:
- we had a reservation, they called us to confirm it was for 700 pm, show up, they say oops we thought 730 pm, they literally have to move people from their seats to accommodate us
- during the 45 minute wait for all this to take place, they took drink orders from us multiple times, but never served us drinks
- they dropped an entire plate of steaming hot chicken fajitas on the ground, it splashed boiling sauce all over people, and their clothes as well
- when i went over to the owner at this point to say - now that we are covered in fajita sauce - can we please have the drinks we keep trying to order? she made a HUGE stink about it, just immediately responded, ""We didn t do any of this on purpose, do you understand? We are doing our best"" and then going to every member of my party reiterating that, as though I had done some rude injustice to her, it was super embarrassing and unprofessional
- drinks still took an extra hour and they weren t good
- they served the birthday girl fajitas with no tortillas or sides, just the meat (she didn t ask for that modification)
- the food was so awful my poor fiance actually sent his BACK -- and this is a guy who complains about NOTHING
- bills took over an hour after asking MULTIPLE times
- the place was so warm they had to keep opening the front door to let in cool air

It almost got 2 stars because they did pay the dry cleaning bill for the jacket that was covered in fajitas sauce, but honestly, I can t forgive the alcohol incident.

It was also served with crispy panchetta and complimentary white anchovies on our salads. This Caesar salad is the best I ve ever had.

1531,"In Chinatown, there is a plethora of Asian dining options to choose from. Recently, I had the opportunity to check out the newly opened 98 Aroma where they offer refined Northern Chinese cuisine. The prices are higher than some of the neighboring establishments, so I highly recommend going with a group of 3-5 people to offset the costs. This way, you can order several dishes to share, as most plates are served with generous portion sizes and are meant for sharing. 

The outside may look unassuming, but the interior was designed to replicate traditional Chinese decor with its elaborate wood ornaments, and Asian-inspired craft works. The dimly lit restaurant sets a very relaxing ambiance, and there are several private booths available along with tables. 

The menu consisted of several popular Northern Chinese dishes like dumplings, scallion pancakes, and spicy seafood and beef dishes. Most of Northern Chinese dishes are characterized by its bold flavors, and dishes are served in big portions. So, you can expect both at 98 Aroma. My friend and I started off with the refreshing Summer Breeze Salad ($9.99) - a colorful mixture of sweet-potato noodles, julienne leeks, bell-peppers, red cabbage, radishes, onions, and carrots with a sweet vinaigrette. 

Northern Chinese cuisine is very wheat-based, so I had to order the Pan Fried Pork and Chives Dumplings ($9.99), which was very good. The crispy potstickers were filled with a generous amount of pork, and the chives gave it a nice aroma after being pan fried. 

Next up was their signature dish, the Steamed Tilapia with Chopped Bell Chilies ($29.99) - the dish arrived in a considerable sized bowl with the bone-in tilapia slathered in a rich yet spicy sauce. The fish was juicy and flaky, and the chili-based sauce complemented it beautifully. However, there were just way too many bones, so be extra careful when eating. 

I enjoyed the crispy texture of the Fried Salt and Pepper Calamari ($15.99), and it was perfectly spiced. 

Out of all the dishes, my least favorite was the Signature Chicken Wings ($15.99). Pricewise, it s pretty expensive for wings, and it was lacking in flavor. The peppers were sporadically spread out to the side, so it wasn t spiced very well.

Overall, I had an enjoyable dining experience at 98 Aroma. The restaurant was bustling with customers that Friday evening, and I thought that the wait staff did a good job of handling the customer service. Since they are a new establishment, there were two new waiters on staff training around that time. They were relatively slow, but it s understandable since they re new. 98 Aroma is a welcome addition to the area as they offer a more refined take on Chinese food, and is sure to please the people in the area looking for a nice place to dine.",2.0

The food arrived super quickly after we ordered which was really nice. We got the spaghetti and meatballs plate, as well as the rigatoni and garden salad. They do shares plates for $3 off, and I believe its around the same portion as a regular plate. Each plate came up to around $20. The portions are huge!! I think the bolognese spaghetti size is larger than the rose rigatoni just because of the pasta difference but they were both amazing! They also have a lot of sauce at the bottom which I love. I also really liked the meatball which was really big. I feel like there could be more herbs in the dishes but that s also my personal preference. The garden salad had a lot of dressing but it was a pretty good size. We had enough leftover for two takeout boxes for lunch the next day.

Are all Mexican restaurants so dim? It seems that the ones I ve been to are always so dark and hard to see. In terms of price it s on the pricey side. My friend took me to a food truck in LA and it was either $1 or $1.50 per taco. I suppose you re paying for the atmosphere and sit down service but ~$6/taco is quite the surcharge. I ll give them that the carne asada taco was tasty but in my opinion that still doesn t justify paying so much per taco. They re small so it s not like you re going to have just 1.

I saw horchata on the menu and decided to try it here. It was very watered down. I didn t taste any cinnamon at all either. definitely not worth $4. 

The server told us that they want to be the best fried chicken place in Toronto. I d say that they have quite a ways to go until they can claim that title. Perhaps it was just the pieces I got but the skin was soft and not crispy. It was also kinda bland without slathering it in sauce. Turns out the dip that we had with the chips was a better accompaniment for the fried chicken instead of the sauce it came with. Go figure. 

That s a lot of negatives that I ve listed. The positives are that our server was great and available when we needed her, the atmosphere was good, we were comfortable and didn t feel rushed to finish our meal. Although, paying for our bill took some time. Maybe the person taking payment didn t realize we were ready to pay because our server came back around after about 15 min of us waiting to speed up the process.

Some of the entrees were a little bland, but everything else definitely had some good flavors, sweet, and fresh!",2.0
97,"I expected to experience a lot of exceptional food while in Toronto for a few days, but being from Southern California I most certainly did not expect to have one of the best contemporary tacos of my life. That s exactly what happened, and everything I thought I knew about Seafood tacos has been shaken. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Seven Lives is a somewhat cramped little shop that s cash only and is prone to both overheating and overcrowding in the Summer. Typically, that s a recipe for disaster as far as service and atmosphere are concerned, but the chaos builds on the hype a bit to be honest and it s all good in my mind given Seven Lives actually delivers on their widespread and now long-standing hype. Hunker down, have your cash ready, and you can expect your tacos in between ten and fifteen minutes after ordering. Until then just sit back and watch them work their magic. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

$6.00 per taco is expensive, plain and simple even with a generous rate of exchange to the USD these days. Even so, the tacos at Seven Lives are at least two to even three times larger than your standard street taco and are jam packed with all sorts of different fillings, which makes the price point worth it. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

For the purposes of emphasis, I m going to set aside what was an exceptional Spicy Chicken taco in its own right just to focus in on the real prize here, which is and was the Gobernador taco. 

Smoked Marlin, Shrimp, Cheese, spices, house made fiery habanero sauce. This was so unexpected, so exceptional, so life-changing that I didn t even know what to do with myself. This was, I think it s fair to say, the very best seafood taco I ve ever had in my entire life, and that s after having visited at least fifty or so seafood taco spots across the United States. Amazing. Two Stars. 

Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?

High Praise for Seven Lives. I read in an interview that at one point the chef had deliberated between opening a shop in Toronto versus Southern California - my vote goes to both. Star.",2.0
264,"I would say La Carnita has one of the best tacos around this area ! There are many selections of tacos and two of my favourite ones are the carne asada and the spicy chorizo. The lunch special have never failed to delight me! The deal is $16.99 + tax for two tacos, one appetizer and one dessert which ends up to be a very good deal ! I would say my favourite appetizer to get is the Mexican corn as it has this creamy cheese coated on top of a roasted sweet corn. Definitely a hot spot to come and try!",2.0
367,"Chilaca, Campechano, shrimp, fish, chorizo, pastor I ve tried it all and it s just simply great! Big bang for the buck. What all the tourists don t know is that this is where it s at, not sure why people are flocking to Seven Lives. 

The tacos are stuffed to brim so prepare for a bit of a messy experience but so worth it at $15 bucks for 3 tacos, which can easily feed 2 leaving you satisfied but not too stuffed. I love that they come with hot sauces with varying degrees of spice (beware of overloading) and if you re lucky at the right time, you may score extra roasted peppers/veggies, lime on the side counter to add in yourself or even a seat to sit at the back. They do open a back patio in the warmer months making it easier to get a spot. Don t expect it to be a place you would want to bring a large group to hang though, it s more in and out. 

Chilaca is their signature dish, a taco with stuffed cheesey pepper, your choice of meat, a crowd fav and a must try if it s your first time. Campechano a decent choice with a mix of meats and cheese. I definitely like the $5 tacos better with a mix of veggies and meat (fish is my fav). If you want an even cheaper way to fill yourself up, multiples of chorizo or pastor tacos are a bargain. Shrimp was probably the least favourite of them all given it was a bit blander than the rest in terms of flavour. 

This is located inside a shared shop along with other food counters all with Latin American flavours. Cheap way to split the rent and keep the prices low.",2.0
77,"I ve had Mexico Lindo bookmarked for quite some time now, and I have to say that I m really satisfied with my first visit at this family run business.

To put it simply, if you re looking for fresh and authentic Mexican food in Scarborough, than I would highly suggest trying this place out.

I ordered the Mexican Combo which kinda gives you a sample of things like chicken enchilada, beef chimichanga, rice and beans. You also get complementary nachos and salsa which was a nice touch before the main food.

Afterwards, I ordered their churros which was really good! You only get 3 of them with caramel, chocolate and a raspberry sauce on the side. 

It is a very small place so i wouldn t recommend coming in a big group. It s probably best for take out or for 2/3 people. I ll definitely be coming back again in the near future to try some of their other food out!",2.0

1062,"Finally made it over here, and I m glad I did. Met with a friend, and made reservations for a weekday, as they still are rather busy. 

For drinks, I had the Sofia Loren I believe, and it was a nice drink to start, but just a little too sweet for my palette. We ordered a bottle of their pinot Nero, which I had never heard of before. It was so delicious! Not overly sweet or dry, and chilled to perfection. I find red wine can make me feel very sleepy if I m having it with a larger meal. 

We ordered the antipasto to start. I did enjoy what I had, but maybe would have preferred more cheese and meat than vegetables. 

For my main, I had the ravioli which was fantastic! It wasn t like 4 tiny pieces that you get at other places. This was a very filling dish that wasn t heavy, and full of flavour. I also am a sucker for truffles. My friend got the veal special and loved it. 

Now I would have given this place a 4, but the service was amazing! Raf was our waitress and was cracking jokes with us all night.

She honestly made the experience memorable, and I hope the restaurant does read this, as she deserves a lot of credit.",2.0

If you re in a party if 2-3 and want to try a variety of dishes, they offer smaller sizes of most dishes. If you re unsure what to order, simply tell them any dietary restrictions and your budget, and they will gladly curate a tasting menu for you.

I would be good with sharing the ceviche app and having two tacos for myself.

The decor is small and cozy, reservations ahead of time is highly recommended but they do leave a bit of space for walk ins.

They also own Good Hombres on Bathurst and Dundas and have even opened a 3rd location somewhere on College st.

Everything on the menu is super delicious. They have large party rooms and can easily seat groups of 8-10 in their main area as well. Highly recommend.",2.0

I m a fan! I ve been to the location near Vaughan Mills quite a while back. The pastas are very traditional and tasty too. If you have a big appetite you will be satisfied. Price point is a bit on the high side, but it is worth it. 

Came on a long weekend in the afternoon and was seated right away. They have the same menu for lunch as dinner (I believe). 

 They serve bread before the mains (I don t think it was baked in house but still good). It comes with balsamic vinegar and EVOO. 

The mains came out quite promptly. I ordered the spinach and ricotta agnolotti. It was quite tasty. The portion size was pretty filling. My friends were also satisfied with their dishes. 

The ambience was also nice. What would make this place even better would be freshly baked bread, fresh butter, freshly grated Parmesan (small details).

It has been open for a bit now so I was hoping that the hype would have died down a little bit. It s still crazy busy! It s actually a little hard to get to where you want to go because of how narrow the aisles are. If people are in browsing mode in front of you there isn t much you can do about it, especially in the main arteries. 

The marketplace style means that there are different stalls that sell different goods - an area for breads, seafood, fresh produce, etc. There are also some stalls with ready to eat food like Roman-style pizza, gelato, coffee, and desserts. Eataly also boasts three of its own restaurants. La Pizza & La Pasta seemed to be the most popular with people taking up all the spaces in the waiting area and long lines just to get a number on the reservation list. La Pescheria, which is their seafood restaurant, had open seating at lunch so if the wait is too long at the other restaurants you can always come here. 

Eataly spans a few floors and is a separate entrance from the Manulife Centre. There are escalators and one elevator that can move you between floors. There are restrooms located on the main level of the Eataly.",2.0
1872,"I give this restaurant three stars. I have been to Lai Wah Heen twice, most recently in January.

Lai Wah Heen is a upscale dim sum restaurant located on the second floor of the DoubleTree by Hilton, in downtown Toronto. The restaurant is spacious and bright, the staff is friendly and the service is excellent.

The dim sum is very good but there aren t many, if any vegetable options so it is quite heavy. Also, it doesn t seem very expensive but the price can increase rather quickly when you purchase a few of the higher priced dishes. The bill was higher when my wife and I went here in January than it was when we took our friend last year for her birthday. We particularly liked the crispy shrimp rolls served with sweet hawthorn sauce and the sticky rice filled with assorted seafood & meat, wrapped & steamed in lotus leaf. The spicy, sweet oyster sauce goes really well with the majority of the dim sum and the tea is excellent.

I will likely return to Lai Wah Heen sometime in the near future. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes dim sum and wants experience eating it in a high end setting. Three stars.",1.0

I came with my partner and we ordered 5 tacos, quesadilla, and an apple soda for $30. This was the best $30 spent on tacos. If you like tacos, I would rate this higher than seven live tacos in Kensington as it s cleaner, more spacious, service is quick and food is amazing.

I came for Valentine s Day dinner and was still able to get a table for a group of 6 a week in advance. 

I ordered the gnocchi and it was alright. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly but the sauce was kind of basic. I ve had better gnocchi elsewhere but for the price point here, I was expecting a bit more. I think some pasta may be more worth it than others on their menu. The homemade gelato was the highlight of my meal - super creamy and soft, great flavour, good portion. I had the hazelnut and pistachio and it was some of the best gelato I ve ever had.

We also got an order of pan fried dumplings to share ($9). We were really happy with everything we ordered.

I was highly anticipating my lunch here since I rarely find authentic Xian restaurants (Northwestern Chinese cuisine) in Toronto. I ordered Xian dishes such as the Steamed Lamb Pita Soup, the Chinese burger (Stuffed Pita), and the Northwestern Cold Noodles. My favourite item was the pita soup. The broth was just rich and flavourful... it would go great on a cold winter day. The cold noodles were a super refreshing part of the meal. Lastly, the Chinese burger (with lamb filling) was pretty good as well. The outer bun was crispy, not too thick, and quite delicious.

Okay, so I only gave 4/5 because my boyfriend speaks Chinese and the lady also speaks Chinese. She was quite nice and accommodating.

I have to hand it to these lovely people, who opened their restaurant for business in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I grabbed one and took it home, then after looking at the interesting array of menu items, I called to place an order. 

In the space of a few days, I have ordered from them twice now. The food is absolutely delicious - truly authentic northern Chinese selections made with wholesome, quality ingredients (yay Sichuan peppercorns and doubanjiang!) The dumplings are explosive and fresh, the rice and noodle dishes are scrumptious, and the portions are huge for the price! 

Finally, the man that works there is SO friendly and kind. The space is spotless and well-organized for clean, touch-free take out.

1699,"One thing I noticed in Toronto is that there are many homemade noodle shop, and there is one on Spadina Avenue that I enjoyed a lot. Homemade Ramen ( ) sells authentic lan zhou ramen ( ). Once you enter the shop, you can see a chef at the back pulling noodles non-stop. They make the noodles fresh to order, and they have 6 different noodles to choose from. Each has a different thickness and width. 

We ordered two items to share, and of course, we have to order a bowl of Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, as well as Shredded Pig s Ear with Chili.

For the Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, the default noodles are regular, which are 2.5mm wide. However, I decided to change to leek leaves, which are 5mm flat noodles. Once our order was in, the chef started to pull noodles, though I wasn t sure if he is making our orders. Within 10 minutes, our noodles arrived. The broth is clear and light, with few beef slices and pickled radish. The portion is huge, so it is perfect to share. The noodles are perfectly cooked, nice and chewy. I love the broth so much, and I am surprised by the addition of pickled radish in the soup - the combination goes super well together. 

The Shredded Pig s Ear with Chili came as well. It looks spicy, but it is not. It is on a sweeter side, with the addition of bell peppers. I prefer having just the shredded pig s ear with minced garlic and chili oil on its own. The bell peppers are not necessary here. 

*** Overall Impression ***

Homemade Ramen is another gem on Spadina Avenue. It has good service, clean ambiance, and most importantly, inexpensive noodles. You can get a bowl of noodles for less than $10 here, and I can guarantee that you will leave with a full stomach! Although I didn t try much here, I will definitely revisit and try other noodle bowls! My recommended item here is the Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, and I think the leek leaves width and thickness are perfect.

Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery has been opened for 3 years and they are cranking out unique and flavorful treats. 

I have never imagined miso being in ice cream, so when I tried the Miso Mon Cheri, I was initially confused, but quickly appreciated the idea that ice cream could taste savory as well. I also ordered a small side of the Totaro (Ube) based on their puff cookies. It was amazing and perfect what I needed. 

With over 20 flavors and 4 vegan flavors, I am not surprised why this is a popular place to visit. The shop is small and there usually is a line so my advice is to head over when they open. I believe I came over around 1pm, but check their hours. Other tip, you can only sample 1 flavor. I m glad that rule is in place as I would be here all day eating everything.

Note: they do no take reservations unless it s for a large private space booking. 
We went with their $65/person set menu option of which I was able to choose the apps (Olive knots, bruschetta pizza and Frito Misto) of which the olive knots were my favs having some of the warmest and delicious olives I ve had.
I also ordered in addition to that their meat and cheese platters, which were great and quickly devoured!

For the mains we ordered their Garganelli which was a huge hit even with the strongest of meat fans in our group. At this point we were all well and stuffed and had no idea that the meat/fish/chicken options would be as large as it was, and then we also had to make room for their dessert platter with bread pudding, chocolate molten cake, canoli and gelato, all so heavenly!

The only thing I would not do is order seared fish to go because it doesn t arrive fast enough to be fresh. Get sashimi not seared for takeaway. 

I was happy with salad and rapini, while my friend was happy with the sashimi. I made a marinade of coconut vinegar, habanero sauce, garlic and coconut aminos for the sashimi as it was seared, it was starting to smell like fish.

1307,"Bang bang, into my heart you ice cream fiend. I think I found Toronto s baddest ice cream shop and am reviewing it for my 1400th review on Yelp!

This popular ice cream joint was made for the ice cream connoisseur. The moment you walk in, you are greeted with so many options that are made weekly to serve. From London Fog to even boba, there were some really unique flavors that you could sample. I was a huge fan of their mango sticky rice which used actual rice in their ice cream. The small grain made such a difference in texture and taste.

Once you ve chosen your ice cream(s), you choose how you want it presented whether as an ice cream cookie sandwich, a waffle cone, or just in a cup. Altogether, you can really modify and change how you enjoy this delectable dessert. Each cup ends up being about $7 so it s on the steeper side but the quality makes up for the price.

The ice cream here at Bang Bang was on point. So smooth, creamy, and worth the wait you may endure.

Overall service was good but I did feel some pressure in selecting my ice cream and cone choice. There was no line when we first arrived but shortly after, it picked up. Before I even got a chance to try all the flavors I wanted, I felt the side eye from the server and quickly chose and left.",2.0
1120,"Tried Nodo tonight based on a recommendation from a work colleague. Tomorrow I will be giving this colleague a big high five. What a find! 

Nodo has the perfect fusion of rustic and culture...Italiano, of course. The staff seem to really care and provide just enough attention to the table so you don t have to wonder.

Special shout out to Emmanuel, a stand up guy and provides great recommendations. 

The food, no question, won t disappoint. We tried a variety of dishes, apps and deserts. I d order it all again. 

Very easy five stars for Nodo.",2.0

Not only was the food tasty, but the aesthetic finishing of the dishes were beyond excellent. I strongly recommend the Truffle beef Carpaccio; shaved black kale salad; and Roasted butternut Raviolis.

202,"Last Saturday, I sampled a number of food items from different food stalls at the Annex Food Hall. I have been on a taco kick since late December 2019. It must have been eating all that Christmas turkey and wanting a change. Naturally, I had to try what El Nahual Tacos had to offer.

I had already had some food from Mean Bao. Although the deal for three tacos for $13 was mighty appealing, I didn t want that much food. Instead, I went with the fish taco, and chips and salsa. Perfect!

The fish is cod in the taco. I m good with a flaky fish. I waited for a bit for my order. Moments later, my food was ready.

The fish taco was delicious. I love how fresh the fish was. The batter was thin and crispy, which it should be. The taco was perfect and the flavours in the taco were spot on. The chips were hot out of the fryer. The salsa had mild cilantro in it. It was okay, but I was hoping for more of a tomato version of salsa. I still ate it all.

I was with a number of friends that evening. We ended up getting more tacos, and chips with salsa. So much food! I grabbed a pulled beef taco. I give it full marks for tenderness. However, it was super salty for my liking. I remember feeling thirsty afterwards and drinking a ton of water to balance my system out. I then felt bloated... haha!

I d love to try more tacos here. I have the inclination that the pulled versions of their proteins are heavy on the sodium, so I ll steer away from them. The food is yummy here, despite that minor setback.

1003,"A group of us went for dinner at La Piazza within Eataly. Note this restaurant s dishes are meant to be like tapas and a shared family style - about the size of appetizers. We ordered aranchini, marinated mackerel (scombro), a white (quattro formagi) and a red pizza (bufalo), spinach ricotta ravioli (quadrati), and the rainbow trout entree with fingerling potatoes. Our favorites were the quadrati (al dente with a flavorful creamy filling and lemony sauce to cut the richness), the aranchini (so creamy & cheesy!), and the rainbow trout which was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin. The scombro was very good as well. Extremely underwhelming was the pizza which we wouldn t recommend; the white cheese pizza was sparse on the cheese and very dry, and while the bufalo had more flavour due to the tomato sauce is was soggy/spongy. 

Service was excellent and attentive without being invasive - and our lovely server corrected an ordering error I made without fuss or hesitation when I accidentally ordered the wrong pizza. We were not charged for it which was really appreciated, given it was our first time there and an honest mistake. 

And the whole of Eataly is just fun to eat and shop your way through. Recommend for a great night out!",1.0

I just had a way better experience here than the last time I came which should be noted. The bbq pork and roast pork were very moist, full of flavour, and the portion was good. For $7.50, I d much rather get a lunchbox here, than... ahem... the neighbouring joints. I like the soup here too.

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don t let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot..

1650,"Let me first say that I was walking into this restaurant expecting to give this place a 4-star (if not 5-star review). I was skeptical of the reviews that rated this place under 4-stars because of raving reviews from co-workers of mine. However, that co-worker went to this place the Friday before I came and also deemed the quality has declined. So maybe it is worthwhile reading on my review as to why that s the case.

My friend and I ordered three things so i ll describe each item below- starting with the best.

1. Green beans- if all the other food was as good as this one, I would ve given this place a 4-star review. Fresh, flavorful, and on-point. The wringly green beans stir-fried into the peppers and mushrooms were fantastic. However, this was a very small plate for it to cost $11. Quality: 4.5/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5.

2. Fried rice- this was their featured fried rice and a recommendation from the co-worker. I m not a fried rice person to begin with but chose this because of the rec. This was just fried rice I could get at any chinese restaurant in chinatown for probably 75% of this cost. It was a lot but not memorable. Quality: 3.5/5. Price for the food amount: 4/5 

3. Boiled pork and chive dumplings- having chosen the healthier version of the dumpling options (versus fried), these turned out to be the most disappointing meal here. The dough/skin of the dumpling was very thick (and this is my greatest fear). The ratio of meat to skin was probably 1:2.5. Quality: 2/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5. You can get the same dumplings but WAYYYYYY better at dumpling house in Chinatown. Thank me later and go there.

So in conclusion, if you re looking for the hype of this place that came from BlogTO or other reviewers, this place will not meet your standards. I would go elsewhere for chinese food- specifically Chinatown; unless you want the aesthetics and hip vibe, then this place got that nailed down.",1.0
1835,"Would give 3.5 overall, but closer to 4 than 3.

Prices are unbeatable as you really cant get any cheaper than 10 dollars half a roasted duck! Service is quick. Fresh meats provided and the roast on their duck is pretty decent, although I prefer it to be a little more roasted in general, but if you prefer your roasted duck to be on the slightly crispy and juicy rather than a bigger crunch with darker skin, this will definitely be a good place to start.

Also got the pork loin drumsticks (not sure exactly what it is in English) and those were just ok. I probably wouldn t order it again as the price for 3 was equivalent to the half duck! 

Rice with one meat is also only a price of $5. Cheap eats cant get any better than this.",2.0
1676,"Came in around 8 PM and it was still quite busy, though the restaurant isn t that big maybe 30-40 seats.

Service is pretty good you can see a waitress going around from time to time checking up on water refills.

This restaurant specializes in crossing bridge rice noodle soup, which you might have seen with the platter of a ingredients beside a stone bowl of hot broth and a bowl of rice noodles on the side. They have a dozen different soup bases for you to choose from whether you like it spicy, sour, or something light.

I ordered the new kimchi soup. It arrived in about 10 minutes, but it was hot and visibly boiling in the bowl. Had a nice flavor; not too salty not too spicy. The soup was quite light in texture, not too much grease, and easy to go down. There s enough soup for two or three refills of noodles if you have a larger appetite.

The ingredients provided include a piece of shrimp, mushrooms, chinese sausage, ground meat, sliced meat, and tofu, which is a pretty nice mix.

According to the menu they have a daily afternoon special between 2 and 5 where you can get any noodle, a cold dish, and a soft drink for only $10.99 which is pretty nice if you re having a late lunch, or an early dinner.",2.0

First of all, their sashimi are so fresh and tasty! Also loved the presentation, they serve the sashimi over ice which was pretty cool and helps keep the sashimi colder.

The appetizers are amazing! Loved the scallop, prawn and oyster. I also NEED to mention how cute the plates they serve the appetizers in. Out of curiosity, we actually asked the server where they got them, and she said that they got it straight from japan which was very cool!

The filet mignon was HEAVENLY. The steak was so tender, it felt like the steak melted in my mouth! The roasted vegetables that were served with the steak tasted amazing with the steak.

Forgot to snap a pic of the aburi sushi, but in my opinion miku has one of the best torched pressed sushi in downtown toronto! Their aburi sushi never dissapoint as they re always top quality.

As for desserts, their signature green tea opera cake was amazing! It has a really nice matcha flavour and i loved the texture!

We started with the meatballs appetizer and those things were melt in your mouth amazing. The marinara was so rich and flavourful we were ecstatic when the server dropped off some bread so we could soak up every last bit of it. 

We opted to share a couple things since neither of us had been there before:

The Bolognese Rigatoni and the Diavolo Pizza. Both were great but the real standout was the Rigatoni. We both heavily favoured it. The sauce was rich and hearty the pasta perfectly al dente, there was absolutely nothing lacking in this dish. 

The only down downside to our experience here was we did have to wait with dirty dishes on our table (which is my biggest restaurant pet peeve) for about 15 minutes after we had finished eating to get our bill. Normally this would really bother me but the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the food really made this place enjoyable.

2) MACCHERONCINI DI CAMPOFILONE - aka Lobster pasta
Yes yes yes! I can have this everyday, all the time, at all times of the day. Do get this dish if there s ONE thing you choose from the menu. 

3) SALSICCINE - surprisingly, the pizza was just okay. If I go here, I probably would focus more on their raw and cured selections of meats and fishes as well as their pastas. I would like to give them another chance on a different pizza.

I love their taco selection. I generally get the fish and beef options anywhere I go but I really love the mushroom taco at Wilburs. The best part of going to the restaurant itself is their selection of delicious hot sauces and salsa options! 

I like that they are a hybrid self serve restaurant. You order at the bar and they bring the food to you but you have to get up and help yourself to the (unlimited) water from the cooler and also the sauces.

When the tacos came out, the Crispy General Tao Taco s sauce seemed to have drenched all the other ones as well, so the tacos were very soggy, and didnt leave much of an impression.

I studied Yelp for a good while trying to find a dim sum place with good reviews. I looked at all different menus from different places and decided on this place. It was cash only so I had money exchanged after we crossed into Canada. We drove 2 hours (there was traffic) to get there. Had to pay for parking. It was a small hole in the wall place with literally 8 small tables total. I ve been in many hole in the walls so no judging there...especially if the taste of the food was out of this world good! Not in this case...I must say that I ve had better dim sum at a mediocre place in VA. MD by far has the best dim sum so if you re in the Rockville area, try out the dim sum there, both Cantonese and Taiwanese style! 
Anyways my family liked it but their not Chinese (my mixed family of Blasians) so to them, dim sum is dim sum. They did agree that we have better dim sum back home in VA/MD. 
The selection wasn t as great either but I did see the cook in the back making the dumplings fresh. My youngest son love dumplings and he commented that it wasn t as good as my mom s lol. Duh..of course grandma makes the best dumplings.

456,"This is, hands-down, the best mexican food place in Toronto! And I would know! I live in Cuidad de Mexico, DF, and have travelled (with locals) pretty much every corner of Estados Unidos de Mexico!

In Toronto I ve tried every single mexican restaurant in the core (no suburbs), including Los Colibris (high end), Caballito, Grand Electric (fusion), etc. etc.

NONE of the above places are as good as this one. None, even the pricey ones! 

Cinco is a very small restaurant and it gets really busy around brunch on weekends. They have a special brunch menu, but their regular one is also available. The best items on the menu are tacos and they come in two varieties: specialty (lots of goodies) and regular (simple). Specialty tacos are around $8 - two are enough for the average guy (150lbs), while the regular are around $5 and you d probably need three to feel full. They also have a salsa bar with different heat salsas - but they are all sooo goood!!!

The service is good but not servile. When it gets busy sometimes they forget stuff (no free chips), but just remind them. The flavors of the pork belly and specialty pork are to die for! I pity the people who don t eat the tastiest meat out there because they are missing on an amazing flavor and texture experience. The chicken is also good, but the pork is waaay better. In DF, pork Tacos al Pastor are the main street food, and here they are replicated almost exactly.

Now a word for vegans (one nasty review down the screen, scroll down, you ll find it) - JUST KEEP MOVING! This is not a restaurant for you! I can t believe the lady who wrote the review ordered the tacos without meat AND without cheese!!!??? What s left? NOTHING - that s what! The slow cooked meat with it s juices and mixed with the melted cheese, both soaking into the corny (see what I did there) tortilla is the essence of the food experience here. During my time in Mexico I didn t meet a single local vegetarian/vegan. That should tell you about the essence of the cuisine.

1617,"I ve been on a dumpling craze for a while and I finally found a place I absolutely love.

Yummy Yummy Dumpling lives up to it s name. The store is located off of Dundas on Huron St (there s actually a huge sign that directs you to the store). It s located in a basement-like space and is smaller than expected.

The no-frills restaurant is served by a no-frills owner. She has very basic English but is understandable. The menu is quite extensive for such a small place. Vegetarian options are also indicated! You write the order # down on a paper and hand it in. So simple. 

The dumplings are freshly made & you can see a lady in the front window steadily hand making them. You can get them boiled, steamed, or pan-fried.

We ordered
1. Sesame Sauce Noodle: This was my least favorite and you can skip it. We thought it would be spicy but nope. This sesame sauce was thick.
2. Squid and Chives Dumpling, Fried; DELICIOUS. A must try. The crispiness of the dumpling was A+.
3. Chicken, Cabbage, and Mushroom, Boiled: YES! Since I don t eat pork and my friend doesn t eat beef - this was a great compromise. 
4. Cucumber and Jelly Fish: The jelly fish was a little different than what I was used to. The whole dish was really refreshing.

The price is great for how much we ate. I had left-overs for dinner the next night and they were still pretty good. 100% my fave dumpling place in Chinatown.",2.0

348,"La Chingada is located on the north side of Dundas just east of Dovercourt.

It s not often I have the opportunity of going to soft openings of places that aren t officially open yet. I was searching for a place to grab a quick small bite and have a drink before going to the Stephen Bulger Gallery just down the street. I didn t find much interesting between Gladstone and Dovercourt so I decided to walk a bit further east and I see ""Mexican street food"". Hello, harbor in the storm.

So I discovered that La Chingada has only opened 5 days ago and not even officially yet. Their official opening is this Friday (March 1st). I really had only about half an hour to order, eat and get to our event so I thought this was a perfect spot. 

I ll admit that I too am spoiled by Mexican food from southern California. It s a snob thing kind of how my wife scoffs at things like the Olive Garden or Pizza Hut Italian Bistro trying to pass off their cuisine as Italian. I get it. People are used to places that serve the best of the best and once they are spoiled it s hard to dial things back to whatever may be available to us. In this case, La Chingada is not only north of Bloor, north of the US border but also north of the Mexican border as well. Let me just say that regardless of geography this place serves some of the best tacos I ve ever had the opportunity of tasting.

So while I had ordered 6 different tacos this was within 2 visits within 3 hours of each other. Honestly I wasn t planning on going back so soon but one of my friends that wasn t with my other friend and I the first time wanted to give it a try after I had spoken just going there.

The first visit I had ordered the barbacoa, tinga de pollo, carnitas and chorizo. The barbacoa and chicken were my friend s order but I had a taste of the barbacoa and the beef was rich and full of flavor. I loved the compliment of the tangy queso fresca that topped it as well.

My plate consisted of the carnitas and the chorizo. Chorizo is normally my favorite filling and while it was a solid savory choice I had to give it up to what I thought was the true champion of the evening which was the carnitas. I loved the bit of crisp to the pulled pork and the meat was very juicy but not wet. Does that even make sense? I normally really enjoy carnitas but these were beyond that. These were without a doubt the best carnitas I ve had. My wife makes carnitas and thankfully, she won t read this review. It s ok because we ll end up coming here sometime soon and she ll get to try them and I won t need to say anything. It s sort of the equivalent of watching a movie and my wife saying wow, that actress is so pretty. Ya, I just won t answer because it s a trap.

The second visit my friend that didn t come the first time ordered the chicharrone. These weren t the kind of pork rinds you find in a plastic bag at the grocery store chip aisle. Dang these were huge pieces of rind. I had to break pieces apart because they were so big. The rinds came with tomatoes, a green salsa and some guacamole.

For my second round I had ended up ordering the blackened fish and carne asada. The fish was very good, grilled with a flaky texture. I forgot to ask what fish they used but it wasn t a strong flavor and a lighter fish. The carne asada was also very good and very filling.

The portions here seem quite generous but the quality and mix of flavors are all pretty well balanced. I liked the variety, presentation, flavors and overall quality of the food here. The tortillas are real deal corn tortillas with a dense integrity. There s no need to ""double up"" since they aren t thin and won t disintegrate because of the filling. These tacos although they are quite filled (some filling may fall out) I found kept their shape and they didn t fall apart and weren t awkward. Being able to pick them up and eat them to me is a huge plus. If you ve been to other places perhaps you ll know what I mean when I say sometimes you just can t do that but here it s all good.

Both times we had the same server and both times she was very friendly and helpful. I think it was just serendipity coming across La Chingada while looking for a place to eat. It s not everyday I come across places like this by just walking 2 blocks looking for something.",2.0
153,"If I m in the mood for no frills authentic tacos, El Trompo is definitely my spot. They range from the classic Al Sador tacos, to a delicious vegetarian option with mushrooms. They also have delicious salsas for you to top your tacos with. While this is definitely not my number 1 taco place, it definitely easily makes the top 5. This is what I imagine at a local taco spot in Mexico!

I ve also tried the molten lava cheese pots (cheese with onions, yes please), the cactus salad and the guac. The guac is absolutely delicious, with the tomato adding just the right amount of citrus. Cactus salad, is citrusy and refreshing, a perfect break in between bites of spicy tacos. It has a texture of a cooked squash, and definitely something to try.

If you re looking for an inexpensive, no frills taco spot, with extra offerings, definitely the perfect spot!",2.0
1892,"We have ordered from this restaurant numerous times, and we were very satisfied on every occasion. They have sushi, salads, soups, Chinese food, and lots of other yummy options to satisfy your hunger. This is a solid bet if you are craving Asian food in the area.",2.0
1116,"Atmosphere in this restaurant was nice food was delicious but I can t tell you how cheap they are on their drinks
Tall skinny Glass half filled with ice maybe a quarter of a can of pop/coke you re getting $2.30 per serving it left such a bad taste in my mouth I felt ripped off really think about it your customers are paying $23 for a plate of pasta and you can t provide them a full can or a decent portion of your fountain drink really really cheap and I ve never seen anything like it in all of my travels so for that is why I m leaving a three star",1.0
1829,"Food was ok nothing special. 
The taste was more blend i don t know i thought after reading the reviews it will be a good place but I didn t like the food flavors. 
We ordered a lot of food.
After waiting so long that someone s gonna pick up our order.
To this counts noodle with beef, crispy fried noodles, veggies and dumplings and beef pancake.
Actually I liked the beef pancake and the dumplings.
When we were finished we ordered the bill. 
A lady came with the takeout boxes and then the drama starts I don t know the lady was packing the food and she throws angry the empty plate on the table. 
She got so upset first I thought I gave here to less tip and then I was like no it can t be. 
So she was so angry she went to the other waiters and keep on pointing to our table and she was like angry like no tomorrow. 
I was literally shocked what happen to her. 
Trying to ask but well she didn t speak English.
So I ignored them all of them. 
I don t know maybe she got mad that I couldn t finish my food.
So my advice for this place is nothing special. If you want some waiter getting angry at you for no reason sure go ahead. This place is not recommended from my side.",0.0
396,"Amazing tacos. Totally authentic. The menu is in Spanish but the staff speak English. Watch for the salsas - they are hot! 
Another tip: if you want tacos, you need to be there during the first shift (before 9pm, I believe). Otherwise, they only make tortas. They re okay, but not as good as the tacos.
The butcher shop part of the store in the back seems a bit odd -- hardly any stuff in the refrigerator -- but adds to the unique ambience of the place.",2.0
1046,I have always loved Levetto so my visit to this location did not disappoint. We ordered the carbonara and the lamb ragu pasta. Both were amazing. The portions here are always good and pasta is cooked perfectly al dente which I appreciate. My only complaint was that our order was taken wrong at first and that the waitress didn t come fill up our water until we had to ask. They also offered a free dessert if you check in on Yelp so be sure to do so. We had the panna cotta to share and it was also very good.,2.0
1641,Delicious braised beef brisket with rice (large). Soaks up the sauce nicely. 4 different spice levels. I choose Mild. $15.99 for a large. Amazing lunch for a cold winter day. Clean restaurant.,2.0
